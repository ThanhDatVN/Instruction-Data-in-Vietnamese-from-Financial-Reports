STATEMENT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
Statement of Responsibility of the Board of Management of the Company in respect of
the Interim Separate Financial Statements
The Board of Management of Hoa Sen Group (“the Company”) is responsible for preparing the
interim separate financial statements of the Company which give a true and fair view of the
interim separate financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2025, and the interim
separate results of its financial performance and its interim separate cash flows for the six­
month period then ended. In preparing these interim separate financial statements, the Board
of Management is required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• prepare the interim separate financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Board of Management is responsible for ensuring that proper accounting records are kept
which disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time, the interim separate financial position of
the Company and enable interim separate financial statements to be prepared which comply
with the basis of accounting set out in Note 2 to the interim separate financial statements. The
Board of Management is also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud or error.
Approval of the Interim Separate Financial Statements
We hereby, approve the accompanying interim separate financial statements as set out on
pages 5 to 59 which give a true and fair view of the interim separate financial position of the
Company as at 31 March 2025 and of the interim separate results of its financial performance
and its interim separate cash flows for the six-month period then ended in accordance with
Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and
applicable regulations on preparation and presentation of interim separate financial statements.
Users of these interim separate financial statements of the Company should read them
together with the interim consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries
(“the Group”) for the six-month period ended 31 March 2025 in order to obtain full information of
the interim consolidated financial position and interim consolidated results of operations and
interim consolidated cash flows of the Group.

REPORT ON THE REVIEW OF INTERIM SEPARATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF HOA SEN GROUP
We have reviewed the accompanying interim separate financial statements of Hoa Sen Group
(“the Company”) which were prepared on 31 March 2025 and approved by the Board of
Management of the Company on 29 May 2025. The interim separate financial statements
comprise the interim separate balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, the interim separate income
statement, the interim separate cash flow statement for the six-month period then ended, and
explanatory notes to the interim separate financial statements including significant accounting
policies, as set out on pages 5 to 59.
The Board of Management’s Responsibility
The Board of Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and the true and
fair presentation of these interim separate financial statements of the Company in accordance
with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and
applicable regulations on the preparation and presentation of interim separate financial
statements, and for such internal control which the Board of Management determines is
necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of interim separate financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim separate financial statements based
on our review. We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review
Engagements 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity.
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
Vietnamese Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance
that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying interim separate financial statements do not present fairly, in all material
respects, the interim separate financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2025, its
interim separate financial performance and its interim separate cash flows for the six-month
period then ended in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese
Corporate Accounting System and applicable regulations on the preparation and presentation
of interim separate financial statements.
Other Matter
The report on the review of interim separate financial statements is prepared in Vietnamese
and English. Should there be any conflict between the Vietnamese and English versions, the
Vietnamese version shall take precedence.
