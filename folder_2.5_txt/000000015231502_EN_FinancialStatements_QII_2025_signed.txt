■ An investment is classified as trading securities when it is held for the purpose of buying and selling to make a profit.
Trading securities are recorded at historical cost in the accounting books. The cost of trading securities is determined
by the fair value of payments made at the time of the transaction, Total any transaction costs associated with the
purchase of trading securities.
- The recognition time for trading securities is the time when the company gains ownership rights, as follows:
+ For listed securities, they are recognized at the time the order is matched (T+0).
+ For unlisted securities, they are recognized at the time the ownership rights are officially obtained according to
relevant legal regulations.
Interest, dividends, and profits from periods, which are before the investment is acquired, are accounted for as a
reduction in the value of the trading securities. Interest, dividends, and profits from periods after the trading securities
are purchased are recognized as financial income. Dividends received in the form of stock dividends are tracked only
in terms of the increase in the number of shares, without recognizing the value of the shares received, or are recorded
at face value.
Page-03Convertible shares are determined at fair value on the exchange date. The fair value of shares is determined as follows:
+For listed shares, the fair value is the closing price on the stock market at the exchange date. If the stock market does not
trade on the exchange date, the fair value of the shares is the closing price of the preceding trading session.
+For unlisted shares traded on the UPCOM market, the fair value is the closing price of the shares on the UPCOM market
at the exchange date. If the UPCOM market does not trade on the exchange date, the fair value is the closing price of the
preceding trading session.
+For other unlisted shares, the fair value is either the price agreed upon by the parties in the contract or the book value at
the time of the exchange.
A provision for the devaluation of trading securities is made for each type of security traded on the market where the
market value is lower than the historical cost. Regarding the determination of the fair value of listed trading securities on
the stock exchange or those traded on the UPCOM market, the fair value of listed trading securities is the closing price at
the end of the fiscal year.
In case the stock market or the UPCOM market does not trade on the fiscal year-end date, the fair value is detennined by
the closing price of the preceding trading session.
Any increase or decrease In the provision for the devaluation of trading securities at the end of the fiscal year is
recognized as financial expense.
h) Held-to-maturity investments
Investments are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the intention and ability to hold them until maturity.
Held-to-maturity investments include: term deposits (including promissory notes and bills of exchange), bonds, preferred
shares with a mandatory buyback by the issuer at a specified future time, and held-to-maturity loans for earning periodic
interest, and other held-to-maturity investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at historical cost, which includes the purchase price and any related
transaction costs. After initial recognition, these investments are recorded at recoverable value. Interest income from held-
to-maturity investments after the purchase date is recognized in the income statement on an accrual basis. Interest earned
prior to the purchase is deducted from the cost at the time of purchase.
When there is strong evidence that part or all of the investment may not be recoverable and the loss is reliably^
determined, the loss is recognized as a financial expense for the year and is directly deducted from the investment’s V
value
