3.3. Basis of consolidation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Bank and its
subsidiaries for the accounting period from 01 January 2025 to 31 March 2025. Subsidiaries are
fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Bank obtains control,
and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. In case the Bank divests
its equity interest in a subsidiary resulting in loss of control over the subsidiary, the Bank only
consolidates the financial result of the subsidiary from the beginning of the period up to the date of
the divestment without consolidating the net assets of the subsidiary. Furthermore, the Bank makes
adjustments of indirect impact of the divestment transactions on the consolidated cash flow
statement.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent
company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-company balances, income and expenses and unrealized gains or losses result from intra­
company transactions are eliminated in full.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of the profit or loss and net assets not held by the
Bank and are presented separately in the consolidated income statement and within equity in the
consolidated statement of financial position.
3.4. Basis of assumptions and uses of estimates
The presentation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Board of Management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported «
amounts of income, expenses, and provisions. These estimates are based on assumptions about
Idi
several factors with varying degrees of subjectivity and uncertainty. Therefore, actual results may
differ, leading to adjustments to the related items in the future. 0

4.7. Investment securities (continued)
4.7.3. Measurement
Debt securities are initially stated at cost, including transaction costs and other directly attributable
costs. They are subsequently recognized at amortized cost (affected by premium/discount
amortization) less provision for credit risk and diminution. Premium and discounts arising from
purchases of debt securities are amortized to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line
basis from the acquisition date to the maturity date.
Post-acquisition interest income of available-for-sale debt securities and held-to-maturity debt
securities is recognized in the consolidated income statement on an accrual basis. The accrued
interest before the Bank purchases debt securities will be deducted from the value of the accrued
interest account when received.
Provision for diminution in value of securities is made when the carrying value is higher than the
market value in compliance with Circular No. 48/2019/TT-BTC dated 08 August 2019 (“Circular
48”), as amended and supplemented by Circular No. 24/2022/TT-BTC dated 07 April 2022
(“Circular 24”) issued by the Ministry of Finance. Provision for diminution is recognized in the “Net
gain/(loss) from investment securities” item of the consolidated income statement.
For Government bonds, Government-guaranteed bonds and municipal bonds, the Bank does not
make provisions for these investments.
For corporate bonds that are listed, registered for transactions, the market price of bonds is the
latest transaction price at the Stock Exchange within 10 days to the reporting date. If there is no
transaction within 10 days to the reporting date, no provision is calculated for these investments.
The Bank is required to make provision for credit risk for corporate bonds (including bonds issued
by other Cis) which have not yet been listed on stock exchanges or have not yet been registered
for trading on the UPCoM trading system under Circular 31 and Decree 86 as described in Note
4.6.
Other unlisted debt securities (excluding unlisted corporate bonds mentioned above) are stated at
cost less provision for diminution in value determined by market value of securities. If there is no
market value or market value cannot be determined reliably, these securities will be recognized at
their carrying amount.
Provision for investment securities will be reversed when a subsequent increase in the recoverable
amount of the investment securities is due to an objective event occurring after the provision is
recognized. Provision is reversed only up to the carrying amount of these securities before
provision has been made.
4.7.4. De-recognition
Investment securities are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from these
securities expired or when the substantial risks and rewards of ownership of these securities have
been transferred.

4.8. Other long-term investments
Other long-term investments represent investments in other entities in which the Bank holds less

investment date and recognized subsequently at cost less provision for diminution in the value of
other long-term investments (if any).
in cases where the shares of the invested entities are registered for trading on the Unlisted Public
Company Market (UPCoM), provisions for impairment are made when the actual market price,
determined as the average reference price over the 30 consecutive trading days before the
financial statement date as announced by the Stock Exchange, is lower than the cost of the
investment. If the shares of the joint-stock company registered for trading on the UPCoM have no
transactions within 30 days before the financial statement date, the Bank determines the provision
level for each investment according to the regulations similar to the cases of other investments
below.
Accordingly, at the time of preparing the consolidated financial statements and/or at the end of the
Bank's fiscal year, if the investments in economic organizations have decreased in value compared
to the investment value, the Bank makes provisions for these investments according to Clause 2,
Article 5 of Circular 48.
Based on the consolidated financial statements of the invested economic organization prepared at
the same time as the Bank's consolidated financial statements, provisions for each unlisted
investment or registered on the UPCoM are calculated according to the following formula:
Actual rate of charter Parties' actual
Actual equity
Level of capital (%) of the investment capital at the
nonitol nf hiioinôoo
provision enterprise at an business organization
for = usiness organization X receiving capital - organization at the
time of making the
investment at the time of making contribution at the time

the provision of making the provision
In the event that the economic organization receiving the capital contribution does not prepare a
financial report simultaneously with the Bank's provisioning, the Bank will base its provisions upon
the most recent financial report of that organization.
4.9. Fixed assets
Fixed assets are presented at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization.
The initial cost of fixed assets includes the purchase price of the asset, including import duties,
non-refundable input taxes, and directly related costs to bring the asset to its intended use

and any resulting gains or losses from the disposal are recognized in the consolidated income
statement.

Deferred tax is provided for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred
income tax liability is provided for all temporary differences; deferred income tax asset is only
provided when there is enough taxable profit in the future for deducting the temporary differences.

4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
4.18. Principles and methods for recognizing corporate income tax and corporate income tax
expenses (continued)
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets must be reassessed at each reporting date and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to
allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax assets to be utilized. The unrecognized deferred
tax assets will be reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has
become probable future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be utilized.
The deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement except when it relates to items
recognized directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the
same taxable entity and the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The tax amounts payable to the State budget will be finalized with the tax office. Differences
between the tax amounts payable specified in the book and the tax amounts under finalization will
be adjusted when the tax finalization has been issued by the tax office.
4.19. Offset *
\
Financial assets and liabilities can only be offset and presented at their net value in the
consolidated statement of financial position when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to offset
them and intends to settle both simultaneously or realize the assets and settle the liabilities j>
concurrently. (
4.20. Derivatives
The Bank engages in foreign exchange forward contracts, swap contracts, and futures contracts
to enable customers to manage, adjust, or mitigate foreign exchange risk or other market risks, as
well as to serve the Bank's business objectives.
Foreign currency forward contracts
Foreign currency forward contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specific currency at a
predetermined exchange rate on a future date, settled in cash. These contracts are initially
recorded at their nominal value on the transaction date and subsequently revalued periodically.
The difference arising from this revaluation is recorded in the "Foreign Exchange Differences" item
within "Owners' Equity" and transferred to the consolidated income statement at the end of the
accounting period.
Currency Swap Contracts
Currency swap contracts are commitments that include a commitment to buy and a commitment
to sell the same amount of one currency for another at exchange rates determined at the time of
the transaction, with different settlement dates for the two commitments. The premium or discount
resulting from the difference between the spot exchange rate on the effective date of the contract
and the forward rate will be recognized immediately on the effective date of the contract as an
asset if positive or a liability if negative on the consolidated financial statements. This difference
will be amortized on a straight-line basis into the consolidated income statement over the term of
the contract.

4.20. Derivatives (continued)
Interest Rate Swap Contracts
The notional amounts of interest rate swap contracts are not recognized on the consolidated
financial statements. The interest rate swap differential is recognized in the consolidated income
statement on an accrual basis.
4.21. Employee benefits
Post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefits are paid to retired employees of the Bank by the Social Insurance
Agency which belongs to the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs. The Bank is required to
contribute to these post-employment benefits by paying social insurance premium to the Social
Insurance Agency at the rate of 17.5% of employees' basic salary plus other allowances. The Bank
has no further obligation.
Voluntary resignation
The Bank has the obligation, under Article 46 of the Vietnam Labor Code No. 45/2019/QH14
effective from 01 January 2021, to pay allowance arising from voluntary resignation of employees,
equal to a half of monthly salary for each year of employment up to 31 December 2008 plus salary
allowances (if any). The average monthly salary used in this calculation is the average monthly
salary of the latest six-month period up to the resignation date. Accordingly, the working time at
the Bank to calculate the severance payment is the total actual working time at the Bank minus the
time employees participating in the unemployment insurance in accordance with the law on G
unemployment insurance and the working time for which severance allowances have been paid ^
by the employer.
Unemployment allowance >
According to Article 57 of Law of Employment No. 38/2013/QH13 effective from 01 January 2015
and Decree No. 28/2015/ND-CP dated 12 March 2015 of the Government on guidelines for the
Law on Employment in term of unemployment insurance, the Bank is required to contribute to the
unemployment insurance at the rate of 1% of salary and wage fund of unemployment insurance
joiners and deduct 1% of monthly salary and wage of each employee to contribute to the
unemployment insurance.
4.22. Segment Reporting
A segment is a separately identifiable component of a Bank that engages in business activities and
risks that are distinguishable from those of the other segments. The Bank's primary segment is
reported on a geographic basis. The Bank's secondary segment is reported on a business line
basis. Currently, the Bank primarily operates in the banking business, which involves the regular
conduct of the following activities: accepting deposits, granting credit, providing payment services,
and other banking activities. Accordingly, the Executive Board is of the opinion that the Bank has
only one business segment, banking operations, and that the Bank's risks and returns are reflected
in this single business line. Therefore, the Bank does not need to present detailed segment reports
by business line.

4.23. Items with zero balances
Items that are not presented in these financial statements pursuant to Decision No. 16/2007/QD-
NHNN dated 18 April 2007, and Circular No. 49/2014/TT-NHNN dated 31 December 2014, on the
financial reporting regime for credit institutions issued by the State Bank of Vietnam on 31
December 2024 are items with zero balances.
4.24. Business combination and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of a business
combination is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange plus any costs directly attributable to the business
combination. Identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business
combination are measured initially at fair values at the date of business combination.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost being the excess of the
cost the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquirer’s
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of a business combination is less
than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly
in the consolidated income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less
any accumulated amortization. Goodwill is amortized over five-year period on a straight-line basis.

Current Corporate Income Tax
The current corporate income tax ("CIT") payable is determined based on the taxable income for
the current period. Taxable income differs from the income reported in the consolidated income
statement because taxable income excludes income items that are taxable or deductible in
different periods due to differences between the Bank's accounting policies and current tax
regulations, and it also excludes items that are non-taxable or non-deductible for tax purposes.
The Bank's current corporate income tax payable is calculated at the tax rates that have been
enacted by the end of the accounting period.
The Bank's tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities. As the application of tax laws
and regulations can be interpreted in various ways, the tax amounts presented in the consolidated
financial statements may be subject to changes according to the final decision of the tax authorities.
The current corporate income tax rate of the Bank is 20% (2024: 20%).

35. RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
This section provides details on the risks that the Bank may encounter related to financial
instruments and describes in detail the policies and methods the Bank uses to control these risks.
The most significant financial risks that the Bank may face related to financial instruments include:
- Credit risk;
- Market risk;
- Liquidity risk. T
35.1. Credit risk (\
Credit risk is the risk that a party involved in a financial instrument or contract, such as a customer,
3
fails to fulfill their obligations, resulting in financial loss. Credit risk arises from lending and
guaranteeing activities in various forms.
The Bank also faces other credit risks arising from investments in debt securities and other risks
in the Bank's trading activities ('transaction risk'), including non-equity trading portfolio assets,
derivatives, and settlement balances with counterparties.
The Bank maintains a credit risk management policy that ensures the following fundamental
principles: establishing an appropriate credit risk management environment; operating under a
sound credit granting process; maintaining an appropriate credit administration, measurement, and
monitoring process; and ensuring adequate control over credit risk.
35.2. Market risk
Market risk is the risk of adverse fluctuations and changes in market risk factors (including interest
rates, exchange rates, securities prices, and commodity prices on the market, etc.) that negatively
impact the Bank's income and capital. Market risk arises from open positions in interest rates,
currency products, and equity instruments, all of which are affected by general market movements
and specific market changes, as well as changes in the volatility of market prices such as interest
rate risk, currency risk, and other price risks.

35.2. Market risk (continued)
35.2.1. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises when there is a difference of term in repricing of interest rate between
assets and liabilities. All credit activities, mobilization activities, investment activities of the Bank
arise interest rate risk.
On the basis of the state of “interest rate sensitivity" according to periodic changes in interest rates,
the items which are assets, equity and off-balance sheet assets are classified by terms into the
table “interest gap” of the Bank.
Interest rate repricing terms for items with fixed interest rates are the remaining period until maturity
date of assets, as for floating interest rates are the remaining period until the nearest repricing
date.
The followings assumptions and conditions are applied when constructing “interest gap” table:
► Cash and gold, capital contribution, long-term investments, fixed assets, other assets and other
liabilities are classified as “Non-sensitive to interest rate” items;
► The interest rate repricing terms for trading securities and investment securities are determined
based on the remaining contractual maturity at the date of the consolidated financial statements
if such securities have a fixed interest rate, or based on the interest rate repricing terms if such
securities have a floating interest rate;
► The interest rate repricing terms for trading securities and investment securities are determined
based on the remaining contractual maturity at the date of the consolidated financial statements
if such securities have a fixed interest rate, or based on the interest rate repricing terms if such
securities have a floating interest rate;
► The interest rate repricing terms for deposits and loans to the SBV and other Cis; derivative
financial instruments and other financial assetsand liabilities; loans to customers; deposits and
borrowings from the Gorvenment and SBV; deposits and borrowings from other Cis; and
deposits from customers are determined as follows:
- For items with a fixed interest rate throughout the term of the contract: the actual interest
rate repricing term is based on the actual maturity date calculated from the date of the
consolidated financial statements;
- For items with a floating interest rate: the actual interest rate repricing term is based on the
most recent interest rate repricing term calculated from the date of the consolidated financial
statements;
- For demand deposits: the interest rate repricing term will correspond to the stability of the
demand deposit portfolio overtime, based on the results of analyzing the behavior of this
portfolio in a moderately stressful scenario;
► The interest rate repricing term for the issuance of securities is based on the contractual
payment/maturity period of each type of security if the security has a fixed interest rate or based
on the contractual interest rate repricing terms if it is a floating rate.

Currency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments fluctuates due to exchange rate
movements. The Bank was established and operates in Vietnam with the Vietnamese Dong as its
functional currency. The Bank's primary transaction currency is also the Vietnamese Dong. The
Bank's loans and advances to customers are mainly in Vietnamese Dong and US Dollars.
However, some of the Bank's other assets are in foreign currencies other than Vietnamese Dong
and US Dollars. The Bank has established position limits for each currency. Currency positions are
monitored daily, and hedging strategies are used by the Bank to ensure that currency positions are
maintained within the established limits.

35.2.3. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may be unable to fulfill its payment obligations related to
financial liabilities when they become due, particularly in the absence of alternative capital sources
when customers withdraw funds. The consequences could include the Bank's inability to pay
depositors or meet its lending commitments. The Bank manages liquidity risk through the following
strategies:
► Controlling the capital mobilization and loan on daily basis;
► Maintaining investment portfolio securities that are easily convertible to cash;
► Controlling liquidity indices in the financial status report in compliance with the regulations of
the State Bank of Vietnam.
The maturity of assets and liabilities represents the remaining term of the assetsand liabilities from
the time of preparing the financial statements until the final payment as stipulated in the contract
or issuance terms.
The following assumptions and conditions are applied in analyzing the maturity of the Bank's assets
and liabilities:
► Balances with the SBV are classified as demand deposits, including compulsory deposits. The
level of compulsory deposits depends on the composition and terms of the Bank's deposits from
customers;
► The maturity term of trading securities and investment securities is based on their individual
maturity dates. Government securities, although classified as long-term, are highly liquid and
can be easily converted to cash. The maturity of equity securities in subsidiaries is determined
