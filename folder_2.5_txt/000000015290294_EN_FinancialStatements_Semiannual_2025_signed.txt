REVIEW OF INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION PERFORMED
BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR OF THE ENTITY *
To: Shareholders
Board of Directors and Management
DANANG BOOKS AND SCHOOL EQUIPMENT STOCK COMPANY
We have reviewed the accompanying interim financial statements of Danang Books and School Equipment
Stock Company (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) prepared on 06 August 2025 as set out from page
5 to page 36, which comprise the interim balance sheet as at 30 June 2025, and the interim income statement,
and interim cash-flow statement for the six-month period then ended, and notes to the interim financial
statements
Management's Responsibility
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these interim financial statements in
accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, and Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and
relevant legislation as to the preparation and presentation of interim financial statements and for such internal
control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of the interim
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with the Vietnamese Standards on Review Engagements 2410- Review
of Interim Financial Information Performed by Independent Auditor of the Entity.
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially
less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing and consequently
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be
identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
interim financial statements do not give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the interim financial
position of the Company as at 30 June 2025, and of its interim financial performance and its interim cash flows

NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.1. Use of estimates
The preparation of the interim financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that impact the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, contingent assets and
liabilities reported in the notes as well as revenues and expenses for the financial period ended 30
June 2025. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of all relevant
information available at the date when the financial statements are prepared, this does not prevent
actual figures differing from estimates.
3.2. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, cash in transit and current
investments for a period not exceeding 3 months or highly liquid investments which are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in
value.
3.3. Financial investments
Held to maturity investments
Held to maturity investments comprise held to maturity investments to earn periodical profits and other
held to maturity investments.
If there is any certain evidence that part or all the investments are irrecoverable, impairment losses are
recognised as a finance expense in the current period.
3.4. Account receivables
Recognition method
ị
Account receivables are stated at the carrying amounts of trade receivables and other receivables less
provisions for doubtful debts.
Provision for doubtful debts
As of the date of preparing the financial statements, provision for doubtful debt is recognised for past-
due accounts receivable and for accounts receivable where circumstances indicate that they might not
be recoverable when due at the level as guided in prevailing regulations. The determination of the
overdue period of a doubtful receivable to be provisioned is based on the principal repayment period
according to the original sale contract, excluding the debt extension between the parties.
The difference between the required balance and the existing balance of provision for doubtful debts is
recorded as a general and administrative expense in the income statement.
3.5. Inventories
Inventory measurement
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The costs of inventories shall comprise all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs
incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. The cost of work in progress
i
I and finished goods includes materials, direct labour and attributable production overheads based on
normal levels of activity.

NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
The costs of purchase of inventories comprise the purchase price, non-reimbursable taxes and duties,
and transport, handling and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of inventories. Trade
discounts and sales rebates on substandard and obsolete goods purchased are deducted from the
costs of purchase.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated
costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Method of accounting for inventories
Inventories are measured using the weighted average method and are recorded under the perpetual
inventory method.
Provision for decline in value of inventories
As of the date of preparing the financial statements, provision is recognised for obsolete, slow-moving
and defective inventory items and an excess of the cost of inventories over their net realisable value.
The difference between the required balance and the existing balance of the provision for a decline in
value of inventories is included in cost of sales in the income statement
Inventories are written down to net realizable value item by item. For services being rendered,
provision is made in respect of each service for which a separate selling price is charged.
3.6. Tangible fixed assets

Tangible fixed asset recognition
Tangible fixed assets are initially recognised at their cost. The cost of purchased tangible fixed assets
comprises the purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the assets to their present
location and working condition for their intended use. Accessories added to fixed assets when
purchased are recognised separately at their fair values and deducted from the historical cost of the
respective tangible fixed assets.
Depreciation and amortisation
The costs of fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:

lessor applicable to similar assets.
3.9. Investment property
Investment properties are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation. Investment properties held
for capital appreciation are not depreciated but subject to impairment review.

amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of other considerations given to acquire an
asset at the time of its acquisition or construction. The costs include initial transaction charges.
Investment property depreciation
The cost of an investment property is depreciated on a straight-line method. Investment properties
held for capital appreciation are not depreciated but an impairment test is required.
The estimated useful lives of investment properties are as follows:
Year 2025
■ Buildings, structures 05-25 years
a Indefinite land use rights No depreciation
The transfer to, or from, investment property shall be made when, and only when, there is a change in
use, evidenced by:
■ Commencement of owner-occupation, for a transfer from investment property to owner-occupied
property;
■ Commencement of development with a view to sale, for a transfer from investment property to
inventories;
■ End of owner-occupation and being subject to an operating lease to another party, for a transfer
from owner-occupied property to investment property;
■ Commencement of an operating lease to another party; for a transfer from inventories to
investment property

property.
Such transfers from, or to, investment property, do not change the carrying amount of transferred
assets and original cost of property when measuring value of assets or preparing the financial
statements.

EXPLANATION
REGARDING THE DECREASE IN AFTER-TAX PROFIT FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2025
COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2024
To: State Securities Commission of Vietnam
Hanoi Stock Exchange
The business result for the first 6 months of 2025 of the Company recorded an after-tax profit of VND
1,728,864,330, a decrease of 18.96%, equivalent to a reduction of VND 404,646,126 compared to the same
period in 2024 (after-tax profit for the first half of 2024 was VND 2,133,510,456), due to the following reasons:
Regarding revenue and gross profit:
Net revenue from sales of goods and services in the first six months of 2025 decreased by VND 1,342,826,479,
equivalent to a 3.82% decrease compared to the same period in 2024.
Most of the product categories with declining sales included textbooks, children's books, various types of
stories, office supplies, cultural products, and office leasing services.
Revenue from printed products increased.
Revenue from retail activities of bookstores slightly increased compared to the same period.
Revenue from wholesale sales of textbooks declined.
Due to the above reasons, gross profit for the first six months of 2025 decreased by VND 221,395,768,
equivalent to a 2.51% decrease compared to the same period in 2024.
Regarding expenses:
Total selling and administrative expenses in the first six months of 2025 increased by VND 151,228,866,
equivalent to a 2.35% increase compared to the same period in 2024.
The expense items that increased included: electricity, outsourced services, transportation, insurance, etc.
The expense items that decreased included: packaging materials, tools and supplies, fixed asset depreciation,
repairs, salary provisions, overtime, etc.
Regarding financial income and other income:
Financial income and other income in the first six months of 2025 decreased by VND 119,534,364,
equivalent to a 34.32% decrease compared to the same period in 2024, mainly due to a reduction in term
deposits, which led to a decline in interest income.
The above is the Company’s explanation of the reasons for the decrease in after-tax profit for the first six
months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.
Respectfully submitted.
