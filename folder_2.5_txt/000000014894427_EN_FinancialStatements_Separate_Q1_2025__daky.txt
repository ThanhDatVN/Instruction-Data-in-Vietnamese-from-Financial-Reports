The separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Vietnamese
Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and applicable
regulations on preparation and presentation of the separate financial statements. The
separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The accompanying separate financial statements are not intended to present the separate

accordance with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in countries and
jurisdictions other than Vietnam. The accounting principles and practices utilised in Vietnam
may differ from those generally accepted in countries and jurisdictions other than Vietnam.
Separately, the Company has also prepared consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) in accordance with Vietnamese
Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and applicable
regulations on preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements. In the
consolidated financial statements, subsidiary undertakings, which are those companies over
which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, have been fully
consolidated.
Users of these separate financial statements of the Company should read them together with
the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the three-month period ended 31
December 2024 in order to obtain full information of the consolidated financial position and
consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows of the Group.
The separate financial statements in the Vietnamese language are the official statutory

period end.
Provision for diminution in value of investments held to maturity is made when there is
evidence that the investment is uncollectible in whole or in part. Changes in the provision
balance during the accounting period are recorded as an increase or decrease in financial
expenses. A reversal, if any, is made only to the extent the investment is restored to its
original cost.
Investments held to maturity are classified into short-term and long-term investments held to
maturity on the separate balance sheet based on the remaining period from the separate
balance sheet date to the maturity date.

amount of provision to recognise at the period end.
(d) Investments in other entities
Investments in other entities are investments in equity instruments of other entities without
controlling rights or co-controlling rights, or without significant influence over the investee.
These investments are accounted for initially at cost. Subsequently, the Board of Management

Lendings are classified into short-term and long-term lendings on the separate balance sheet
based on the remaining term of the lendings as at the separate balance sheet date.
2.10 Construction contracts
A construction contract is a contract specifically negotiated for the construction of an asset or
a combination of assets that are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of design,
technology and functions or ultimate purpose of use.

paid, contract revenue and contract costs are recognised over the period of the contract as
revenue and expenses, respectively for the works performed and certified by customer. The
compensation and other revenue are only recognised in revenue when certified by customer.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be reliably estimated, contract revenue is
recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable those costs will be
recoverable. Contract costs are only recognised when incurred during the period.
2.11 Business cooperation contract
A business cooperation contract (“BCC”) is a contract between the Company and other parties
to carry out specific business activities without establishing a new legal entity. These activities
are controlled by one of the parties. The BCC is based on shares of post-tax profits. The

13CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION NO 1 JOINT STOCK COMPANY
Form B 09a - DN
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.11 Business cooperation contract (continued)
A BCC in the form of shares of profits after tax is jointly controlled or controlled by one party.
• If a BCC states that each party is entitled to a fixed amount of profit regardless of the
performance of the BCC, it is a lease of asset in substance.
• If the BCC states that each party is entitled to profits when the BCC is profitable and is
required to bear losses when the BCC is loss making, in subtance, the BCC parties share
revenue and expenses because each party can jointly control the operation and cash
flows of the BCC.
When the Company is not in charge of accounting and tax finalisation, the Company accounts
for its proportionate share of revenue and expenses from the BCC.
2.12 Fixed assets
Tangible and intangible fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortisation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the fixed
assets bringing them to suitable conditions for their intended use. Expenditure which is
incurred subsequently and has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits
expected to be obtained from the use of fixed assets, can be capitalised as an additional
historical cost. Otherwise, such expenditure is charged to the separate income statement
when incurred in the period.
Depreciation and amortisation
id
Fixed assets are depreciated and amortised using the straight-line basis so as to write off the
depreciable amount of the fixed assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciable amount
equals to the historical cost of fixed assets recorded in the separate financial statements
minus (-) the estimated disposal value of such assets. The estimated useful lives of each
asset class are as follows:
Buildings and structures 3-25 years
Machinery and equipment 3-7 years
Motor vehicles 6-8 years
Office equipment 3-5 years
Software 3 years
Others 5 years
Land use rights comprise of land use rights and prepaid land use rights obtained under land
rental contracts which are effective before the effective date of land law 2003 (ie. 1 July 2004)
and which land use right certificates are granted.
Indefinite land use rights are stated at costs and not amortised.

income statement.
Construction in progress
Construction in progress represents the cost of assets in the course of installation or
construction for production, rental or administrative purposes, or for purposes not yet
determined, which are recorded at cost and are comprised of such necessary costs to
construct, repair and maintain, upgrade, renew or equip the projects with technologies as
construction costs; costs of tools and equipment; project management expenditure;
construction consulting expenditure; and capitalised borrowing costs for qualifying assets in
accordance with the Company's accounting policies. Depreciation of these assets, on the
same basis as other fixed assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended
use.
2.13 Investment properties held for lease
The historical cost of an investment property held for lease represents the amount of cash or
cash equivalents paid or the fair value of another consideration given to acquire the
investment property held for lease at the time of its acquisition or completion of construction.
Expenditure incurred subsequently which has resulted in an increase in the expected future
economic benefits from the use of investment properties held for lease can be capitalised as
an additional historical cost. Otherwise, such expenditure is charged to the separate income
statement when incurred in the period.
Depreciation
Investment properties held for lease are depreciated on straight-line basis to write off the
depreciable amount of the assets over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives
of each asset class are as follows:
Land use rights 50 years
Buildings and structures 25 years
2.14 Prepaid expenses
Prepaid expenses include short-term and long-term prepayments on the separate balance
sheet. Prepaid expenses are recorded at historical cost and allocated on a straight-line basis

2.15 Payables
Classifications of payables are based on their nature as follows:
• Trade accounts payable are trade payables arising from purchase of goods and services;
and
• Other payables are non-trade payables, and payables not relating to purchases of goods

Borrowings and finance lease liabilities are classified into short-term and long-term on the
separate balance sheet based on their remaining period term from the separate balance
sheet date to the maturity date.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of any qualifying
assets are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the
asset for its intended use. In respect of general-purpose borrowings, a portion of which used
for the purpose of construction or production of any qualifying assets, the Company
determines the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation by applying a capitalisation
rate to the weighted average expenditure on the assets. The capitalisation rate is the weighted y
average of the interest rates applicable to the Company’s borrowings that are outstanding
during the period, other than borrowings made specificially for the purpose of obtaining a MG
qualifying asset. Other borrowing costs are recognised in the separate income statement
0
when incurred.

a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provision is not recognised for future
operating losses.

Form B 09a - DN
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.18 Provisions (continued))
Provisions are measured at the level of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the
obligation. If the time value of money is material, provision will be measured at the present
value using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is
recognised as a financial expense. Changes in the provision balance during the accounting
period are recorded as an increase or decrease in operating expenses.
2.19 Unearned revenue
Unearned revenue mainly comprises the amounts that customers have paid in advance for
one or many accounting periods for asset leases. The Company records unearned revenue for
the future obligations that the Company has to fulfil. Unearned revenue is recognised as
revenue in the separate income statement during the period to the extent that revenue
recognition criteria have been met.
Unearned revenue is classified into short-term and long-term on the separate balance sheet
based on the obligations that the Company will perform within next 12 months or normal
business cycle and after next 12 months or after normal business cycle as at separate
balance sheet date.
2.20 Capital and reserves
Owners’ capital is recorded according to the actual amounts contributed at par value of the
shares.
Share premium is the difference between the par value and the issue price of shares and the
difference between the repurchase price and re-issuing price of treasury shares.
Treasury shares bought before the effective date of the Securities Law (ie. 1 January 2021)
are shares issued by the Company and bought back by itself, but these are not cancelled and
may be re-issued subsequently in accordance with the Law on Securities. Treasury shares
brought after 1 January 2021 will be cancelled and adjusted to reduce equity.

Income tax includes all income tax which is based on taxable profits. Income tax expense
comprises current income tax expense and deferred income tax expense.
Current income tax is the amount of income tax payable or recoverable in respect of the
current period taxable profits at the current period tax rates. Current and deferred income tax

separate financial statements. Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the
time of occurrence affects neither the accounting nor the taxable profit or loss. Deferred
income tax is determined at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the accounting period
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the separate balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised
