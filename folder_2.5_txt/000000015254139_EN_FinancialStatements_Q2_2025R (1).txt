7. Inventory recognition principles:
- Principle of inventor}' recognition: Inventories are valued at original cost. In case the net realizable value is lower than the original cost, the
inventories are valued at the net realizable value. The original cost of inventories includes the cost of purchase, processing costs and other directly
related costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
- Method of calculating inventory value: Inventory' value is determined by the weighted average method; Method of determining the value of
unfinished products: unfinished production and business costs are collected according to each project that has not been completed or has not
recorded revenue. For construction activities, unfinished production and business costs are collected according to each project that has not been
completed or has not recorded revenue. For cement production activities, the actual costs incurred for each production stage in the chain are the
costs.

between the original cost of inventory and the net realizable value.

expenses and included in the production and business costs of the fiscal year.
Expenses incurred during the fiscal year but related to the business performance of many accounting years are recorded as long-term prepaid
expenses to be gradually allocated to the business performance in the following accounting years.

nature and extent of each type of expense to select a reasonable allocation method and criteria. Prepaid expenses are gradually allocated into
production and business expenses using the straight-line method.

b) Enterprises monitor in detail the payment terms of loans and financial leasing debts. For debts with a repayment period of more than 12 months

months from the date of the financial statement, accountants present them as short-term loans and financial leasing debts to have a payment plan.
c) Borrowing costs directly related to the loan (other than interest payable), such as appraisal, auditing, loan application preparation costs, etc., are
accounted for in financial expenses. In case these costs arise from a separate loan for the purpose of investment, construction or production of
unfinished assets, they are capitalized.

year because Circular 210/2009/TT-BTC and current regulations require the presentation of financial statements
and disclosure of information regarding financial instruments but do not provide equivalent guidelines for the
assessment and recognition of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities.

balance between risk and risk control.________________ ________________________ _____________

interest rates _

fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates when the Company's borrowings, revenues, and expenses are
denominated in currencies other than the Vietnamese Dong.

fluctuation due to change in market interest rates when the Company has arising time or non-term deposits, loans
and debts subject to floating interest rates. The Company manages interest rate risk by analyzing the competitive
situation in the market to obtain interest rates favorable to the Company's purposes.Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument or cont ract will be unable to fulfill its obligations,
