tax
Reasons :
During the period, the Company was starting to construct new projects, so both
Revenue and Cost of goods sold decreased. The decrease rate of Cost of goods sold is
different from decrease rate of Revenue, leading to an increase in Gross profit on sales and
services rendered this period compared to the previous period.
Financial income in this period increased compared to the previous period due to
exchange rate differences arising from overseas construction activities. The financial expenses
for this period increased compared to the previous period due to a rise in the Company's
interest expenses. Aggregating the above factors, the net profit from operating activities in
this period increased compared to the previous period.
Other profits decreased compared to the previous period, as in the second quarter of2024, the Company generated income from the reversal of warranty provisions for some
projects.
Combining the above factors, the Profit after corporate income tax increased when
compared to the previous period.
