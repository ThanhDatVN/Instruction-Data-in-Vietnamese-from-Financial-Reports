2. Cash
Cash comprises cash balances and call deposits.
3. Investments:
a. Trading securities: Trading securities are those held by the Corporation and its subsidiaries for trading purpose
i.e. purchased for resale with the aim of making profits over a short period of time. Trading securities are
initially recognised at cost which include purchase price plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at cost less allowance for diminution in value. An
allowance is made for diminution in the value of trading securities when there is evidence that market price of
the securities item falls below its carrying amount. For listed equity securities held for trading, the market price *
of securities is the closing bid price at the latest trading date prior to the end of the annual accounting period.
The allowance is reversed if the market price subsequently increases after the allowance was recognised. An
allowance is reversed only to the extent that the securities’ carrying amount does not exceed the carrying ç
amount that has been determined if no allowance had been recognised.
b. Held-to-maturity investments: Held-to-maturity investments are those that the Corporation’s Board of General 1
Directors has the intention and ability to hold until maturity. Held-to-maturity investments include term
deposits at bank. These investments are stated at costs less allowance for doubtful debts.
c. Investments in subsidiaries: For the purpose of these separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries
are initially recognised at cost which includes purchase price plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these investments are stated at cost less allowance for diminution in value. An
allowance is made for diminution in investment value if the investee has suffered a loss which may cause the
Corporation to lose its invested capital, unless there is evidence that the value of the investment has not been
diminished. The allowance is reversed if the investee subsequently made a profit that offsets the previous loss
for which the allowance had been made. An allowance is reversed only to the extent that the investment’s
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no allowance had
been recognised.
d. Loans: according to the original price method
4. Accounts receivable: Trade and other receivables are stated at cost less allowance for doubtful debts. The
allowance was provided based on the assessment by Board of General Directors of the Corporation on the
recoverability of the receivables.
6. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first-in-first-out and
includes all costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable
value is the estimated selling price of inventory items, less the estimated costs of completion and estimated costs
to sell. Allowance for inventories is determined as the difference between cost and net realisable value, in the
case where cost is higher than net realisable value.
The Corporation applies the periodic method of accounting for inventories.
7. Fixed assets, Investment properties
9Cost (tangible fixed assets, Intangible fixed assets, Finance leases, Investment properties: Tangible fixed assets
are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The initial cost of a tangible fixed asset comprises its purchase
price, including import duties, non-refundable purchase taxes and any directly attributable costs of bringing the
asset to its working condition for its intended use. Expenditure incurred after tangible fixed assets have been put
into operation, such as repair, maintenance and overhaul cost, is charged to the separate statement of income in
the year in which the cost is incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure
has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of tangible fixed
assets beyond their originally assessed standard of performance, the expenditure is capitalised as an additional
cost of tangible fixed assets..
Depreciation: Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of tangible fixed
assets; Stipulated by the Corporation and according to Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC dated 25/04/2013 of the

7776/BTC-TCT dated 2 June 2009 of the Ministry of Finance “guiding financial and tax regimes applicable to
traders of bottled liquefied petroleum gas” in recognition and amortisation of cylinder values and deposits for
cylinders. Accordingly, cylinder values are stated at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over 10 years.
Prepaid land costs: Prepaid land costs comprise prepaid land lease rentals, including those for which the
Corporation obtained land use rights certificate but are not qualified as intangible fixed assets under prevailing
laws and regulations, and other costs incurred in conjunction with securing the use of leased land. These costs ^
are recognised in the separate statement of income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Other prepaid expenses: p
Other prepaid expenses include tools and instruments, fire and explosion insurance and other prepaid expenses.
Tools and instruments include assets held for use by the Corporation in the normal course of business whose
costs of individual items are less than VND30 million and therefore not qualified for recognition as fixed assets.

straight-line basis over a period ranging from 2 to 3 years depending on each individual insurance policy.
9. Trade and other payables: Trade and other payables are stated at their cost..
10. Provisions: Except for those defined in other accounting policies, a provision is recognised if, as a result of a
past event, the Corporation has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are
determined by estimates made by the Board of General Directors on necessary expenses to pay for this payable
obligation at the end of the annual accounting period.
11. Share capital: J
Ordinary shares: Ordinary shares are stated at par value. The excess of proceeds over the par value of shares
issued is recorded as share premium. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of shares, net of tax
effects, are recognised as a deduction from share premium.
Repurchase and reissue of ordinary shares (treasury shares): Treasury shares are recognised only in respect of
repurchased shares which are aggi*egated fractions of share arising when the company issues shares to pay
dividends or issues shares from equity reserves in accordance with an approved issuance plan, or repurchased
odd-lots of shares as requested by the shareholders. In all other cases, when shares recognised as equity are
repurchased, their par value amount is recognised as a reduction to share capital. The difference between the
par value and the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of tax effects,
is included in share premium.
- Investment and development fund: Investment and development fund was appropriated from retained profits in
accordance with the resolution of General Meeting of Shareholders. This fund was established for the purpose
of future business expansion.
12. Revenue and other incomes:
Goods sold: Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the consolidated statement of income when the
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. No revenue is recognised if there
are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or the possible return of goods.
Revenue on sales of goods is recognised at the net amount after deducting sales discounts.
10Services rendered: Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the consolidated statement of income in
proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to
surveys of work performed. No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of
the consideration due.

outstanding and the applicable interest rate.

the annual accounting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation
purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of
the annual accounting period.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent s
that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
