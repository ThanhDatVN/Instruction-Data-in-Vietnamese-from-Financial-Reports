controlled by the Holding Company. The control exists when the Holding Company has
the power to directly or indirectly govern the financial and operating policies of the
subsidiary to obtain economic benefits from its activities. In determining the control
power, the potential voting right that is currently valid or will be transferred should also be
taken into consideration as the balance sheet date.
The business results of the subsidiaries which are acquired or disposed during the year are
included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the date of acquisition until the date
of disposal of the investments in those subsidiaries.
The Financial Statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries used for
consolidation are prepared for the same accounting period and apply the consistent
accounting policies for similar transactions and events in similar circumstances. In case
that the accounting policies of the subsidiaries are different from those which are applied
consistently within the Group, the appropriate adjustments should be made to the Financial
Statements of the subsidiaries before they are used to prepare the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Intra-group balances in the balance sheet and intra-group transactions and unrealized intra­
group profits resulting from these transactions are eliminated when the Consolidated
Financial Statements are prepared. Unrealized losses resulting from intra-group
transactions are also eliminated unless costs which cause those losses cannot be recovered.
Interest of non-controlling shareholders shows gains/losses on the business results and net
assets of a subsidiary which is not held by of the Group and is presented in a specific item
in the Consolidated Income Statement and the Consolidated Balance Sheet (the owner’s
equity). Interest of non-controlling shareholders includes value of non-controlling minority
interest as of the initial business consolidation date and that in the fluctuation of owner’s
equity commencing from the business consolidation date. Losses arising in subsidiaries are
allocated equivalent to the ownership rate of non-controlling shareholders, even if those
losses are higher than the ownership rate of non-controlling shareholders in net assets of
subsidiaries.

5. Financial investments
Investments Held to Maturity
An investment is classified as held to maturity when the Group has the intent and ability to
hold it until maturity. Investments held to maturity include term bank deposits.
Investments held to maturity are initially recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price
and transaction costs associated with the purchase of the investments. After initial recognition,
these investments are carried at recoverable value. Interest income from investments held to
maturity after the purchase date is recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss on an accrual
basis. Interest earned before the Group's acquisition is deducted from the cost at the purchase
date.
If there is conclusive evidence that part or all of the investment may not be recoverable, and
the loss can be reliably determined, the loss is recognized as a financial expense for the period
and directly reduces the carrying amount of the investment.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity which the Group has significant influence but not the control to
govern the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is the right to participate
in making the associate’s financial and operating policies but not control those policies.
Investments in associates are recognized in accordance with the owner’s equity method.
Accordingly, the investments in associates are presented in the Consolidated Financial
Statements by the initial investment costs and adjusted for changes in benefits on net assets
of associates after the investment date. If the benefits of the Group in losses of associates
are higher than or equal to book value of the investments, the value of investments will be
presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as zero unless the Group has an
obligation to make the payment instead of associates.
The Financial Statements of associates are prepared for the same accounting period of the
Group. In case the accounting policies of an associate are different from those consistently
applied in the Group, the Financial Statements of that associate will be suitably adjusted
before being used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unrealized gains/losses from transactions with associates are excluded equivalent to those
of the Group when the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared.
6. Receivables
Receivables are recognized at the carrying amounts less allowances for doubtful debts.

according the following principles:

purchase and sale transactions between the Group and customers who arc independent
to the Group.
• Other receivables reflect receivables not concerning the commercial nature and
irrelevant to purchase and sale transactions
Allowance is made for each doubtful debt after being offset with payable liabilities (if
any). The extraction rate is based on the debt age or the estimated loss as follows:

depreciation are written off, then any gain or loss arising from such disposal is included in
the income or the expenses during the year.

incident to ownership belonging to the lessee. Financial leased assets are determined by
their historical costs less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost is the lower cost of the
fair value of the leased asset at commencement of the lease term and the present value of
the minimum lease payments. Discount rate used to calculate the present value of the
minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease or else mentioned in the
lease. If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined, the incremental
borrowing rate at commencement of the lease term will be applied.
Financial leased assets are depreciated in accordance with the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives. If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain
ownership at the end of the lease, (he fixed asset shall be depreciated over the shorter of
the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset. The depreciation years of financial
leased assets are 5-6 years.

amortization are written off, then any gain or loss arising from such disposal is included in
the income or the expenses during the year.

Expenses are those that result in outflows of the Group’s economic benefits and are
recorded at the time of transactions or when incurrence of the transaction is reliable
regardless of whether payment for expenses is made or not.
Expenses and their corresponding revenues are simultaneously recognized in accordance
with matching principle. In the event that matching principle conflicts with prudence
principle, expenses are recognized based on the nature and regulations of accounting
standards in order to guarantee that transactions can be fairly and truly reflected.
21. Corporate income tax
Corporate income tax expenses include current income tax and deferred income tax.
Current income tux
Current income tax is the tax calculated based on taxable income. Taxable income differs
from accounting profit due to adjustments for temporary differences between tax and
accounting, non-deductible expenses, as well as adjustments for non-taxable income and
carried forward losses.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is the corporate income tax payable or recoverable due to temporary
differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and their tax bases. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable
temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are only recognized when it is certain
that future taxable profits will be available to utilize these deductible temporary
differences. 41
V
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed al the end of the accounting
period and reduced to the extent that sufficient taxable profits are not expected to be =
available to allow the benefit of part or all of the deferred income tax assets to be utilized.
Previously unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at the end of the
accounting period and recognized when it becomes certain that sufficient taxable profits
will be available to utilize these deferred income tax assets.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the tax rates expected to
apply in the year the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, using the tax rates that
are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the accounting period. Deferred income
tax is recognized in the Income Statement and only directly in equity when it relates to
items that are directly recorded in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when:
• The Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current income lax assets against
current income tax liabilities; and
• The deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to corporate income taxes levied by
the same tax authority:
- For the same taxable entity; or
