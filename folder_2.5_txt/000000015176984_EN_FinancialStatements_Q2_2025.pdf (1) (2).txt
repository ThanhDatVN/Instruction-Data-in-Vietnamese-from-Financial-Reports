8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company has financial assets such as trade receivables, other receivables, cash and short-term deposits
arising directly from the Company's operations. The Company's financial liabilities mainly consist of loans,
trade payables and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to mobilize financial
resources to serve the Company's operations.
The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Risk management is an integral part of the Company's entire business operations. The Company has
established a control system to ensure an appropriate balance between the costs of risk and the costs of risk
management. The Board of Directors continuously monitors the risk management process to ensure an
appropriate balance between risk and risk control.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees to apply management policies for the above risks as follows:
i. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because
of changes in market prices. There are four types of market risk: interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity
price risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk.
The Company does not have any material risks related to changes in market prices because the Company's
main business is to supply clean water to assigned areas under the direction of Saigon Water Corporation.
The Company's operating expenses are mainly the wholesale price of clean water purchased from the
Corporation. The Company also mainly borrows long-term from banks under 10-year loan contracts with
fixed interest rates and the Company's transactions do not involve foreign currencies.
ii. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or transaction
contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities
(primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and other
financial instruments .
Accounts receivable
The Company regularly monitors its outstanding receivables. For major customers, the Company reviews
each customer for deterioration in credit quality at the reporting date. The Company seeks to maintain close
control over outstanding receivables and has a credit control staff to minimize credit risk. Based on this and
the fact that the Company's trade receivables relate to a large number of different customers, there is no
significant concentration of credit risk to any particular customer .

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Period from 01/04/2025 to 30/06/2025
These notes form an integral part of and should be read in conjunction -with the accompanying financial statements.
The Company mainly maintains its deposits with well-known banks in Vietnam. Credit risk from deposits
with banks is managed by the Company's treasury department in accordance with the Company's policy. The
Company considers that the concentration of credit risk from bank deposits is low.
The Company's Board of Directors assesses that all financial assets are current and not impaired except for
receivables presented in note 5.6.
iii. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will have difficulty in fulfilling its financial obligations due to
lack of funds. The Company's liquidity risk arises mainly from the fact that financial assets and financial
liabilities have different maturity dates.
The Company minimizes liquidity risk by maintaining a level of cash and cash equivalents and bank
borrowings that the Board of Directors believes is adequate to finance the Company's operations and
minimize the risk due to fluctuations in cash flows.
The table below details the Company's remaining contractual maturities for its financial liabilities and their
agreed payment terms based on the earliest undiscounted cash flows on which the Company can be required
to pay:

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the financial instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation.
The Company has not revalued its financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value because Circular
210/2009/TT-BTC dated 6 November 2009 of the Ministry of Finance as well as current regulations do not provide
specific guidance on determining fair value. As at 01 January 2025 and 30 June 2025 . the fair value of financial assets
and financial liabilities corresponded to the carrying value of these items. The Board of Directors believes that the fair
value of these financial assets and financial liabilities is not materially different from their carrying value at the end
of the financial year.
v. Risk prevention
The Company does not apply a hedge accounting policy.
