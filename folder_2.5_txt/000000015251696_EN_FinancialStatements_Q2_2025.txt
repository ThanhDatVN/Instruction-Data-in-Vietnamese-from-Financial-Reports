transfer of short-term securities, securities trading fees; provision for diminution in value of trading securities, provision for impairment of investments in other entities, foreign exchange losses, exchange

- Selling expenses;
+ This account records actual expenses incurred in the process of selling products, goods, or providing services, including marketing, product introduction, advertising, sales commissions, warranty
expenses for products and goods (except for construction activities), storage, packaging, transportation, etc.
+ Selling expenses that are not deductible for corporate income tax purposes under tax law but have valid supporting documents and are properly recorded under accounting regulations are not recorded
