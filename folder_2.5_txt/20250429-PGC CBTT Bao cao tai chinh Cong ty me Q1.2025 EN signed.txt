time. Trading securities are initially recognised at cost which include purchase price
plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they
are measured at cost less allowance for diminution in value. An allowance is made for
diminution in value of trading securities when there is evidence that market price of
the securities item falls below its carrying amount. For listed equity securities held for
trading, the market price of securities is the closing bid price at the latest trading date
prior to the end of the annual accounting period. The allowance is reversed if the
market price subsequently increases after the allowance was recognised. An
allowance is reversed only to the extent that the securities’ carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that has been determined if no allowance had been
recognised.
b. Held-to-maturity investments: Held-to-maturity investments are those that the
Corporation’s Error! Reference source not found, has the intention and ability to
hold until maturity. Held-to-maturity investments include term deposits at bank.
These investments are stated at costs less allowance for doubtful debts.
c. Investments in subsidiaries: For the purpose of these separate financial statements,
investments in subsidiaries are initially recognised at cost which includes purchase
price plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition,
these investments are stated at cost less allowance for diminution in value. An
allowance is made for diminution in investment value if the investee has suffered a
loss which may cause the Error! Reference source not found, to lose its invested
capital, unless there is evidence that the value of the investment has not been
diminished. The allowance is reversed if the investee subsequently made a profit that
offsets the previous loss for which the allowance had been made. An allowance is
reversed only to the extent that the investment’s carrying amount does not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined if no allowance had been
recognised.
d. Loans: according to the original price method
84 Accounts receivable: Trade and other receivables are stated at cost less allowance for
doubtful debts. The allowance was provided based on the assessment by Board of
General Directors of the Corporation on the recoverability of the receivables.
5 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined
on a first-in-first-out and includes all costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their
present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price of
inventory items, less the estimated costs of completion and estimated costs to sell.
Allowance for inventories is determined as the difference between cost and net
realisable value, in the case where cost is higher than net realisable value.
The Corporation applies the periodic method of accounting for inventories
6 Fixed assets, Investment properties : Cost (tangible fixed assets, Intangible fixed assets,
Finance leases, Investment properties: Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. The initial cost of a tangible fixed asset comprises its
purchase price, including import duties, non-refundable purchase taxes and any directly
attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Expenditure incurred after tangible fixed assets have been put into operation, such as
repair, maintenance and overhaul cost, is charged to the separate statement of income in
the year in which the cost is incurred. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated
that the expenditure has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected
to be obtained from the use of tangible fixed assets beyond their originally assessed
standard of performance, the expenditure is capitalised as an additional cost of tangible
fixed assets.
Depreciation: Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of tangible fixed assets; Stipulated by the Corporation and according to
Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC dated 25/04/2013 of the Ministry of Finance.

separate statement of income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
- Other prepaid expenses:

constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined
by estimates made by the Board of General Directors on necessary expenses to pay for
this payable obligation at the end of the annual accounting period.
10 Share capital:

over the par value of shares issued is recorded as share premium. Incremental costs

deduction from share premium.

recognised only in respect of repurchased shares which are aggregated fractions of
share arising when the company issues shares to pay dividends or issues shares from
equity reserves in accordance with an approved issuance plan, or repurchased odd­
lots of shares as requested by the shareholders. In all other cases, when shares
recognised as equity are repurchased, their par value amount is recognised as a
reduction to share capital. The difference between the par value and the amount of
the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of tax effects, is
included in share premium.
-Investment and development fund: Investment and development fund was
appropriated from retained profits in accordance with the resolution of General
Meeting of Shareholders. This fund was established for the purpose of future
business expansion.

-Goods sold: Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the separate statement
of income when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred
to the buyer. No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding
recovery of the consideration due or the possible return of goods. Revenue on sales
of goods is recognised at the net amount after deducting sales discounts.
-Services rendered: Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the separate
statement of income in proportion to the stage of completion of the trans action-at-the
balance sheet date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of
work performed. No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties
regarding recovery of the consideration due.

statement of income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease

they are incurred.

tax. Income tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of income except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case it is
recognised in equity.
-Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax
rates enacted at the end of the annual accounting period, and any adjustment to tax
payable in respect of previous years.
-Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of
deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities using the tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the end of the annual accounting period.
-A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future
taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be
utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Accounting Standards and Accounting Regimes promulgated.
