3. APPLIED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SYSTEM
Compliance with Accounting Standards and System
The Corporation applies Vietnamese Accounting Standards (VAS) and the corporate accounting system
issued under Circular 200/2014/TT-BTC dated December 22, 2014, replacing Decision No. 15/2006/QD-
BTC dated March 20th, 2006, and Circular 244/2010/TT-BTC dated December 31st, 2010, of the Ministry
of Finance.
4. APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits, guarantees, short-term investments, or highly
liquid investments that can be easily converted into cash with low risk of value fluctuation.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at cost. Cost includes direct material costs, direct labor costs, and production
overheads, if any, required to bring inventories to their current location and condition. The cost of
inventories is determined using the weighted average method. Net realizable value is estimated selling
price less costs to complete and costs of marketing, sales, and distribution.
4. APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are presented at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. The historical cost of
tangible fixed assets includes purchase costs and all directly attributable expenses related to making the
asset ready for use. For self-constructed or self-made tangible fixed assets, costs include actual
construction or production costs plus installation and trial operation costs. Tangible fixed assets are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives:
Type of assets Estimated Useful Life (Years)
Buildings and structures 10-40
Machinery and equipment 04- 10
Transportation equipment 04- 10
Office equipment and tools 03-08
Other Tangible fixed assets 05
Investment Properties
Investment properties are recorded at historical cost, including related transaction costs, less accumulated
depreciation.
Subsequent costs related to investment properties are added to the carrying value when the Company
expects to gain additional economic benefits beyond those initially estimated from the property.
Depreciation and amortization of investment properties are calculated on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives as follows:

NOTES TO THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
At as 30th June, 2025
Asset Type Estimated Useful Life
Buildings 25 years
Other properties 5 years
Investment properties are derecognized from the balance sheet after sale or when no future economic
benefits are expected from their use or disposal. Gains or losses from disposal are recognized in the
income statement during the reporting period of disposal.
4. APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Transfers between investment properties and owner-occupied properties or inventories occur only when
there is a change in usage purpose. Transfers do not affect the carrying amount or historical cost of the
properties as of the transfer date.
Construction in Progress h
Assets under construction for production, leasing, administration, or other purposes are recorded at cost.
These costs include service costs and borrowing costs in accordance with the Company’s accounting
policies. Depreciation is applied as with other assets once the asset is ready for use.
Investments in Subsidiaries, Associates, Joint Ventures, and Other Investments
Investments in subsidiaries refer to investments where the investor has control over the investee. Parent
Company's contributions to subsidiaries are presented at cost on the Parent Company's financial
statements. Profits from subsidiaries are recognized when officially declared by the subsidiary's Board of
Directors or General Shareholders Meeting.
Investments in associates refer to investments where the Company has significant influence but does not
have control or joint control over the investee's financial and operating policies.
Joint venture investments are accounted for based on joint venture agreements.
Other investments are those where the Company does not have control or significant influence and are
reflected at cost.
Provisions for investment impairment are made when the Company determines that the decline in value is
not temporary. These provisions are reversed if the recoverable value subsequently increases.
Long-term prepaid expenses
The Company's long-term prepaid expenses include the value of goodwill (brand value) and other long­
term prepaid expenses, which are allocated consistently based on appropriate criteria.
Equity
Owners' equity is recorded based on the actual contributed capital of the owners.
Dividends payable to shareholders are recognized as liabilities in the Company's Balance Sheet after the
Board of Directors of the Corporation announces the dividend distribution.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized when the results of goods transactions are reliably measurable, and the Company
is likely to receive the economic benefits from such transactions. Revenue from services is recognized
when there is evidence of the completion rate of services provided at the end of the financial year.
Interest income from deposits is recognized on an accrual basis, determined based on deposit balances
and applicable interest rates.

Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly related to the acquisition, construction, or production of assets requiring a
substantial period to complete and put into use or operation are added to the asset's initial cost until the
asset is ready for use or operation. Income generated from the temporary investment of loans is deducted
from the asset's original cost.
All other borrowing costs are recognized in the Income Statement when incurred.
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into Vietnamese Dong at the exchange rate on the
transaction date. Exchange rate differences arising from such transactions are recorded in the Income
4. APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Statement. For exchange rate differences arising from the year-end revaluation of cash, deposits, money
in transit, and short-term liabilities (within one year) in foreign currencies at the time of financial
reporting, they are not accounted for as income or expense.
Taxation
Corporate income tax represents the total of current tax and deferred tax liabilities. -
Current tax liabilities are calculated based on taxable income for the year. Taxable income differs from
net profit reported in the Income Statement as it excludes income or expenses taxable or deductible in
other years (including carry-forward losses, if any) and items exempted from tax or not deductible. The
Company's income tax is determined according to current tax regulations, which may change over time,
with final determination depending on the results of audits by tax authorities.
Deferred income tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities in the Balance Sheet and their tax bases. Deferred tax is accounted for using the Balance Sheet
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences, while deferred tax
assets are only recognized if sufficient taxable income in the future is probable to utilize the deductible
temporary differences.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates expected to apply in the year the asset is realized or the liability
is settled. Deferred tax is recognized as income or expense, except when related to items directly credited
or debited to equity. In such cases, deferred tax is also directly credited or debited to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Company has a legal right to offset cuiTent tax
assets against current tax liabilities, and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied
by the same tax authority and the Company intends to settle them on a net basis.
Other taxes are applied following the current tax laws in Vietnam.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share for common stocks are calculated by dividing net profit or loss attributable to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the net profit or loss attributable to common
stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the effects of all
potentially dilutive common shares, including convertible bonds and stock options.
