and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The discount rate used to calculate
the present value of minimum lease payments is the implicit interest rate in the lease or the
interest rate stated in the lease agreement. If the implicit interest rate in the lease cannot be
determined, the borrowing interest rate at the commencement of the lease is used.
Fixed assets under finance leases are depreciated using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives. In cases where it is uncertain whether the Company will obtain
ownership of the asset at the end of the lease term, the fixed asset is depreciated over the
shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful life. The depreciation period for fixed
assets under finance leases is 5 to 6 years.
