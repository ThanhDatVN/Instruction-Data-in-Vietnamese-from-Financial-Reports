recoverable. Contract costs are only recognised when incurred during the period.
2.11 Business cooperation contract

Form B 09a - DN
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.11 Business cooperation contract (continued)
A BCC in the form of shares of profits after tax is jointly controlled or controlled by one party.
• If a BCC states that each party is entitled to a fixed amount of profit regardless of the
performance of the BCC, it is a lease of asset in substance.
• If the BCC states that each party is entitled to profits when the BCC is profitable and is
required to bear losses when the BCC is loss making, in subtance, the BCC parties share
revenue and expenses because each party can jointly control the operation and cash flows
of the BCC.
When the Company is not in charge of accounting and tax finalisation, the Company accounts
for its proportionate share of revenue and expenses from the BCC.
2.12 Fixed assets
Tangible and intangible fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortisation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the fixed
assets bringing them to suitable conditions fortheir intended use. Expenditure which is incurred
subsequently and has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be
obtained from the use of fixed assets, can be capitalised as an additional historical cost.
Otherwise, such expenditure is charged to the separate income statement when incurred in the
period.
Depreciation and amortisation
Fixed assets are depreciated and amortised using the straight-line basis so as to write off the
depreciable amount of the fixed assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciable amount
equals to the historical cost of fixed assets recorded in the separate financial statements minus
(-) the estimated disposal value of such assets. The estimated useful lives of each asset class ; [
are as follows:
Buildings and structures 3-25 years
Machinery and equipment 3-7 years d
Motor vehicles 6-8 years
Office equipment 3-5 years
Software 3 years
Others 5 years
Land use rights comprise of land use rights and prepaid land use rights obtained under land
rental contracts which are effective before the effective date of land law 2003 (ie. 1 July 2004)

assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
2.13 Investment properties held for lease
The historical cost of an investment property held for lease represents the amount of cash or
cash equivalents paid or the fair value of another consideration given to acquire the investment
property held for lease at the time of its acquisition or completion of construction. Expenditure
incurred subsequently which has resulted in an increase in the expected future economic
benefits from the use of investment properties held for lease can be capitalised as an additional
historical cost. Otherwise, such expenditure is charged to the separate income statement when
incurred in the period.
Depreciation
Investment properties held for lease are depreciated on straight-line basis to write off the
depreciable amount of the assets over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives
of each asset class are as follows:
Land use rights 50 years
Buildings and structures 25 years
2.14 Prepaid expenses

Classifications of payables are based on their nature as follows:
• Trade accounts payable are trade payables arising from purchase of goods and services;
and
• Other payables are non-trade payables, and payables not relating to purchases of goods

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of any qualifying
assets are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the
asset for its intended use. In respect of general-purpose borrowings, a portion of which used for
the purpose of construction or production of any qualifying assets, the Company determines the
amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation by applying a capitalisation rate to the
weighted average expenditure on the assets. The capitalisation rate is the weighted average of
the interest rates applicable to the Company’s borrowings that are outstanding during the period,
other than borrowings made specificially for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. Other
borrowing costs are recognised in the separate income statement when incurred.
2.17 Accrued expenses

Form B 09a - DN
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.18 Provisions (continued))
Provisions are measured at the level of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the
obligation. If the time value of money is material, provision will be measured at the present value
using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and
the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is
recognised as a financial expense. Changes in the provision balance during the accounting
period are recorded as an increase or decrease in operating expenses.
2.19 Unearned revenue
Unearned revenue mainly comprises the amounts that customers have paid in advance for one
or many accounting periods for asset leases. The Company records unearned revenue for the
future obligations that the Company has to fulfil. Unearned revenue is recognised as revenue in

business cycle and after next 12 months or after normal business cycle as at separate balance
sheet date.

Share premium is the difference between the par value and the issue price of shares and the
difference between the repurchase price and re-issuing price of treasury shares.

arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the separate
financial statements. Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition

occurrence affects neither the accounting nor the taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is

is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the separate balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
