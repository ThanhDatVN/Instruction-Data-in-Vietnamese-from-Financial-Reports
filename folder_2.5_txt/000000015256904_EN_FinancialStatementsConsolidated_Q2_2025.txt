s
5 Financial investments
5.1 Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates
For the purpose of these financial statements, investments in subsidiaries and associates are initially
recognised at cost, which includes the purchase price and any directly attributable costs.
Provision for impairment of investments is made when the investee incurs a loss, except when the loss
was anticipated by the Company when making the investment decision. Provision for impairment of
investments is reversed when the investee subsequently makes profits to offset the losses for which the
provision was made. The provision is reversed only to the extent that the carrying amount of the
investment does not exceed its carrying amount that would have been determined if no provision had
been made.
5.2 Trading securities
Trading securities are securities held by a company for trading purposes, i.e. purchased for resale.
Trading securities are initially recorded at cost, which includes purchase price plus directly attributable
costs. After initial recognition, securities are measured at cost less allowances for diminution in value of
trading securities. A provision is created when the market value of trading securities is lower than their
carrying amount. After this provision is created, if the market value of trading securities increases, the
provision is reversed. The provision is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of existing
13THANG LONG INVESTMENT GROUP JSC CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
8th Floor - Block B, Song Da Building, Pham Hung Street, Second quarter of 2025
Tu Liem Ward, Hanoi
securities does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been assumed if no provision had been
recognized.
5.3 Held to maturity investments
Held to maturity investments include: Term deposits (including treasury bills and promissory notes),
bonds, preferred shares that the issuer is required to repurchase at a certain time in the future, loans, etc.
held to maturity for the purpose of earning periodic interest and other held to maturity investments.
5.4 Loan receivables
Loan receivables under contracts among parties but not traded or sold on the market like securities.
Depending on each contract, loans under contracts can be recovered once at maturity or gradually
recovered each period. i
For loan receivables, if there is no provision for doubtful debts as prescribed by law, the accountant will )
assess the recovery ability. In case there is certain evidence that a part or the whole of the loan may not
be recovered, the accountant will record the loss in financial expenses in the period. In case the loss
cannot be reliably determined, the accountant will explain in the Financial Statements about the
recovery ability of the loan. V
5.5 Investment in other entities ,
Investments in other entities are initially recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price and any
directly attributable expenses. After initial recognition, these investments are measured at cost less any
provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is made when the investee incurs a loss, except
where such a loss was anticipated by the Company at the time of investment. The provision for
impairment is reversed when the investee subsequently generates profits sufficient to offset previously
recognized losses for which the provision was made. The reversal of a provision shall not result in the
carrying amount of the investment exceeding its original cost as if no provision had been recognized.
6 Receivables
The classification of receivables as trade receivables and other receivables is based on the following
principles:
a. Trade receivables comprise amounts receivable arising from transactions of a commercial nature,
such as receivables from the sale of goods, provision of services, liquidation or disposal of assets
(including fixed assets, investment properties, and financial investments) between the Company and
buyers (independent parties, including receivables between the parent company and subsidiaries, joint
ventures, and associates).
b. Other receivables comprise amounts receivable not arising from commercial transactions and not
related to the purchase or sale of goods or services, such as:
14THANG LONG INVESTMENT GROUP JSC CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
8th Floor - Block B, Song Da Building, Pham Hung Street, Second quarter of 2025
Tu Liem Ward, Hanoi
• Receivables generating financial income, such as receivables from lending interest, deposits,
dividends, and distributed profits;
• Non-trade receivables such as asset lending, receivables from fines, compensations, or shortage of
assets awaiting resolution, etc.
When preparing the financial statements, the Company classifies receivables as current or non-current
based on their remaining maturity.
Provision for doubtful debts is established for each specific doubtful receivable in accordance with
Circular No. 228/2009/TT-BTC issued by the Ministry of Finance on 7 December 2009.
The determination of receivables requiring provision for doubtful debts is based on the items classified
as short-term and long-term receivables in the balance sheet.
Provision for doubtful debts is made for each specific receivable based on the overdue period of the
debt or the estimated potential loss.
7 Inventories
Inventories are recognized at cost. Where the net realizable value is lower than cost, inventories are measured at
net realizable value. The cost of inventories includes purchase costs, processing costs, and other directly
attributable costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. J
The cost of inventories issued is calculated using the first-in, first-out method.
Inventories are accounted for using the perpetual method.
Provision for inventory devaluation is made at the end of the year for the difference where the cost of
inventories exceeds their net realizable value.
8 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible and intangible fixed assets are initially recognized at historical cost. During the usage period,
tangible and intangible fixed assets are recorded at historical cost, accumulated depreciation, and net
book value.
The depreciation method applied: Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives, in accordance with Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC dated 25 April 2013 issued by
the Ministry of Finance.
9 . Investment Properties
Investment properties are recognized as assets when both of the following conditions are met:
° It is probable that future economic benefits associated with the property will flow to the
Company; and
• The cost of the property can be measured reliably.
15THANG LONG INVESTMENT GROUP JSC CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
8th Floor - Block B, Song Da Building, Pham Hung Street, Second quarter of 2025
Tu Liem Ward, Hanoi
Investment properties do not include properties held for sale in the ordinary course of business,
properties under construction for future sale, owner-occupied properties, or properties under
construction intended for future use as investment properties.
The initial cost of an investment property comprises all costs (cash and cash equivalents) incurred by the
enterprise or the fair value of other consideration given to acquire the investment property up to the time
of purchase or completion of construction. Investment properties are initially recognized at historical
cost. During the operating lease period, investment properties are carried at historical cost less
accumulated depreciation and net book value.
Investment properties held under operating leases are depreciated and the depreciation expense is
recognized in business expenses for the period (including periods of temporary vacancy). The Company
estimates the useful life and determines the method of depreciation for investment properties.
Investment properties held for capital appreciation are not depreciated. In cases where there is clear
evidence that the value of an investment property has declined below its market value and the
impairment amount can be measured reliably, the Company reduces the carrying amount of the
investment property and recognizes the impairment loss in cost of goods sold (similarly to the provision
for inventory of real estate properties).
Transfers between owner-occupied property, investment property, and inventory are made only when
there is a change in the purpose of use, such as:
• Transfer from investment property to owner-occupied property when the owner begins to use the ,n
property;
• Transfer from investment property to inventory when the owner begins development with the intention
to sell;
• Transfer from owner-occupied property to investment property when the owner ceases own use and
leases the property to another party under an operating lease;
• Transfer from inventory to investment property when the owner begins leasing the property to another
party under an operating lease;
• Transfer from property under construction to investment property upon completion of construction and
commencement of investment use.
10 Prepaid expenses
Prepaid expenses that are related solely to the current financial year's production and business
activities are recorded as short-term prepaid expenses and fully allocated to production and
business expenses within the same financial year.
The following expenses incurred during the financial year are recorded as long-term prepaid
expenses to be gradually allocated to business results over multiple years:
• Expenses for tools and supplies; insurance expenses;
• Expenses for the repair of mining equipment; and other related expenses.
The calculation and allocation of long-term prepaid expenses to production and business
expenses in each accounting period are based on the nature and magnitude of each type of
16THANG LONG INVESTMENT GROUP JSC CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
8th Floor - Block B, Song Da Building, Pham Hung Street, Second quarter of 2025
Tu Liem Ward, Hanoi
expense, in order to select a reasonable method and basis for allocation.
Prepaid expenses are allocated on a straight-line method.
11 Liabilities
Classification of liabilities as trade payables and other payables is performed based on the following
principles:
a. Trade Payables include amounts payable of a commercial nature arising from transactions of
purchasing goods, services, and assets from suppliers (being independent entities from the buyer,
including payables between the parent company and its subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates).
b. Other Payables comprise amounts payable that are non-commercial and not related to the purchase,
sale, or provision of goods and services, including:
• Payables related to financial expenses, such as interest payable on borrowings, dividends and profits
payable, and investment operation expenses payable;
• Non-commercial payables such as liabilities arising from asset borrowings, fines and compensation
payables, surplus assets pending resolution, and payables related to social insurance, health
insurance, unemployment insurance, and trade union fees, etc.
When preparing the financial statements, the accountant shall classify payables as either current or non- .
current based on their remaining maturity. Where there is evidence indicating that a loss is likely to
occur with certainty, the accountant shall recognize a payable immediately in accordance with the
Conservatism Principle.
12 Accrued expenses
Actual expenses that have not yet been incurred but are accrued in production and business costs during
the period aim to ensure that, when the actual expenses arise, they do not cause sudden fluctuations in
production and business costs, based on the matching principle between revenues and expenses. When
these expenses are actually incurred, if there is a difference compared to the amounts previously
accrued, the accountant shall record an adjustment to either increase or decrease the expenses
corresponding to the variance.
13 Owners’ equity
Owner's contributions are recognized based on the actual amount contributed by shareholders.
Equity funds are appropriated from the company's post-tax profits and, during the course of operations,
are managed and utilized in accordance with the company's charter.
Undistributed profit after tax represents the profit generated from the company's activities after
deducting (-) adjustments arising from the retrospective application of changes in accounting policies
and the retrospective correction of material misstatements from previous years.
14 Revenue recognition
Revenue from sale of goods:
Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when all five (5) of the following conditions are met:
The Company has transferred the majority of risks and rewards associated with ownership of the
product or goods to the buyer;

8th Floor - Block B, Song Da Building, Pham Hung Street, Second quarter of 2025
Tu Liem Ward, Hanoi

goods;
Revenue can be reliably measured;
The Company has received or is expected to receive economic benefits from the sales transaction;
and
The costs associated with the sales transaction can be reliably determined.
Revenue from Rendering of Services:
Revenue from rendering of services is recognized when the outcome of the transaction can be measured
reliably. In cases where the rendering of services relates to multiple accounting periods, revenue is
recognized during the period based on the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet
date. The outcome of a service transaction is deemed to be reliably measurable when all of the
following conditions are satisfied:
- Revenue can be measured reliably;
- It is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the company;
- The stage of completion of the service at the balance sheet date can be reliably measured;
- The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured
reliably. j
i
The stage of completion of the service rendered is determined using the work completion assessment (
method.
In cases where lease payments are received in advance for multiple periods, revenue is recognized
based on the principle of allocating the prepaid lease income over the lease term. If the lease term
covers more than 90% of the asset’s useful life, the company may select to recognize the entire prepaid
revenue at once, provided that all of the following conditions are simultaneously met:
• The lessee has no unilateral right to cancel the lease contract, and the lessor has no obligation
to refund the prepaid lease amount under any circumstances or in any form;
• The prepaid amount is not less than 90% of the total expected lease payments under the
contract over the entire lease term, and the lessee must settle the full lease amount within 12
months from the commencement date of the lease;
• Substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset have been
transferred to the lessee;
• The lessor is able to reasonably estimate the cost of the leasing operation.
Enterprises that recognize revenue based on the total amount of prepaid lease income in this
case must disclose in the financial statements the following:
• The difference in revenue and profit compared to the scenario where revenue would have
been recognized progressively over the lease term;

received, compensation for relocation of business premises, and other similar amounts);
» Penalty income collected from customers for breaches of contract;
• Other income not classified under the above categories.
15 Cost of Goods sold
The cost of goods sold reflects the carrying value of products, goods, and services sold during the
period.
Provision for inventory devaluation is included in the cost of goods sold based on the quantity of
inventory on hand and the difference where the net realizable value is lower than the original cost of
inventory.
In the case of inventory shortages or losses, the related value is charged directly to the cost of goods
sold (after deducting any compensation received, if applicable).
Direct material costs consumed in excess of normal levels, abnormal labor costs, and unallocated fixed
production overheads are also charged directly to the cost of goods sold (after deducting any
compensation received, if applicable), even if the related products or goods have not yet been
recognized as sold.

Financial Risk Management
Financial risks include market risk (comprising interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, and liquidity
risk. The Company does not implement hedging measures against these risks due to the lack of a market
for purchasing such financial instruments.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk arising from its signed interest-bearing borrowings. The
Company is subject to interest rate risk on both floating-rate and fixed-rate borrowings. This risk is
managed by maintaining a reasonable balance between fixed-rate and floating-rate borrowings.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises when customers or counterparties fail to meet their contractual obligations, resulting in
financial losses for the Company. The Company has an appropriate credit policy in place and regularly ‘5
monitors the situation to assess whether it is exposed to credit risk.
Liquidity risk
The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that sufficient funding is available to meet current
and future financial obligations. Liquidity is also managed to maintain a surplus between maturing
liabilities and maturing assets at a controllable level, based on the amount of capital the Company believes
it can generate during the period. The Company's policy is to regularly monitor current and forecasted
liquidity requirements to ensure that adequate cash reserves, bank deposits, and borrowings are maintained
to meet both short-term and long-term liquidity requirements.
