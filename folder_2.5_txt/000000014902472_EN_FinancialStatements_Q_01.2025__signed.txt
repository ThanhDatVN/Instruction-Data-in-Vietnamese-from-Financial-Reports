statements.

results and cash flow situation according to accounting principles and practices generally accepted in
countries other than Vietnam.
IV. Applied accounting policies:
The following are the main accounting policies applied by the Company in preparing financial
statements:
1- Exchange rates applied in accounting:
The Company applies the treatment of foreign exchange differences in accordance with Vietnamese
Accounting Standard No. 10 (VAS 10) “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” and
Circular No. 53/2016/TT-BTC dated March 21, 2016 of the Ministry of Finance, which provides
regulations on the recognition, measurement, and treatment of foreign exchange differences in
enterprises. Accordingly, transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates on the
transaction dates. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies as at the end of the accounting
period are translated at the exchange rate on that date. Any resulting exchange differences are
recognized in the income statement. Foreign exchange gains arising from the revaluation of year-end
balances shall not be distributed to shareholders.
The Company mainly trades in foreign exchange-related derivatives at the Military Commercial Joint
Stock Bank (MB Bank).
2- Principles for determining the actual interest rate (effective interest rate):
The actual interest rate (effective interest rate) is used to discount cash flows for items recognized at
present value based on the commercial bank interest rate at the time the enterprise borrows.
3- Principles for recognizing cash and cash equivalents:
Cash, bank deposits including cash at the fund, demand deposits, term deposits of 1 month with high
liquidity, easily converted into cash and less risk related to fluctuations in value.
4- Principles of accounting for financial investments:
a, Trading securities
Trading securities are securities held by the Company for investment purposes and readily available for
sale. Trading securities are recognized starting from the date of purchase and are initially measured at
cost and related transaction costs of purchasing trading securities.
In subsequent accounting periods, trading securities are measured at cost less any provision for
impairment of trading securities. The provision for impairment of trading securities is made in
accordance with Circular No. 48/2019/TT-BTC dated August 8, 2019 of the Ministry of Finance, which
provides guidance on the making and handling of provisions for devaluation of inventories, loss of

investments, doubtful debts, and product, goods, service, and construction work warranties at
enterprises.
b, Investments held to maturity
Investments held to maturity are investments with fixed maturities and fixed or determinable payments,
and the Board of Directors has the intention and ability to hold them until maturity. Investments held to
maturity are recognized starting from the date of purchase and are initially measured at cost and related
transaction costs of purchasing the investments. Interest income from investments held to maturity after
the date of purchase is recognized on the income statement on an accrual basis. Interest earned before
the Company holds is deducted from the original price at the time of purchase.
Provision for impairment of investments held to maturity is made based on the most recent financial
statements that the Company collects from investees. The Company's Board of Directors believes that
there are no significant changes in the financial statements of these companies compared to the most
recent financial statements the Company used to determine the provision, which would have a material
impact on the provision the Company has made.
c, Investments in subsidiaries and associates
Subsidiaries are companies controlled by the Company. This control is achieved when the Company has
the ability to control the financial and operating policies of the investees in order to obtain benefits from
the operation of these companies.
An associate is a company in which the Company has significant influence but is not a subsidiary or
joint venture of the Company. Significant influence is the power to participate in decisions on the
financial and operating policies of the investee but does not have control or joint control over those
policies.
The Company initially recognizes investments in subsidiaries and associates at cost. The Company only
recognizes as income on the income statement the amount shared from the accumulated net profit of the
investee arising after the date of investment. Other amounts that the Company receives other than shared
profits are considered as a recovery of investments and are recognized as a deduction from the original
investment cost.
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are presented in the balance sheet at cost less any provision
for impairment (if any). The provision for impairment of investments in subsidiaries and associates is
made in accordance with Circular No. 48/2019/TT-BTC dated August 8, 2019 of the Ministry of
Finance, which provides guidance on the making and handling of provisions for devaluation of
inventories, loss of investments, doubtful debts, and product, goods, service, and construction work
warranties at enterprises.
5- Accounting principles for receivables:
Receivables are amounts recoverable from customers or other parties. Receivables are presented at book
value less any provision for doubtful debts.
Receivables are tracked in detail by due date, debtor, type of currency receivable, and other factors
according to the Company's management needs.
The classification of receivables: Accounts receivable from customers, internal receivables, other
receivables are performed according to the principle:
10PETROLEUM EQUIPMENT ASSEMBLY AND METAL STRUCTURE JOINT STOCK COMPANY

Ba Ria - Vung Tau Province, Socialist Republic of Vietnam For the financial period ended March 31, 2025
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FORM NO. B 09-DN
These notes are an integral part and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements.
a) Accounts receivable from customers: Are the payables and the payment status of the Company's
receivables with customers for the sale of products, goods, and provision of services.
b) Internal receivables: include receivables between the Company and its dependent branches.

transactions, such as receivables that generate financial revenue, such as receivables for deposit interest,
dividends, profits to be distributed; receivables for fines, compensation,...; Expenses paid on behalf of
third parties are entitled to be recovered.
When preparing financial statements, the accountant bases on the remaining term of the receivables to
classify long-term and short-term debts. Customer receivables are detailed for each object, each
receivable content and recorded for each payment. In detailed accounting, the accountant classifies
debts, types of debts such as those paid on time, bad debts or those that are unlikely to be recovered, to
have grounds and measures to handle uncollectible debts or to make provision for doubtful debts.
Provision for doubtful debts
Provision for doubtful debts is made for receivables that are overdue for payment for six months or
more, or receivables that the debtor is unlikely to pay due to liquidation, bankruptcy or similar
difficulties.
The accountant identifies receivables that meet the definition of monetary items denominated in foreign
currencies for revaluation at the end of the period when preparing financial statements.
6- Principles for recognizing inventories:
Inventories are determined on the basis of the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of
inventories includes direct materials costs, direct labor costs and production overheads, if any, to bring
the inventories to their present location and condition. The cost of inventories is determined by the
weighted average method. Net realizable value is determined as the estimated selling price less the
estimated costs to complete the product together with marketing, selling and distribution costs incuiTed.
The Company's provision for decline in value of inventories is made in accordance with cunent
accounting regulations. Accordingly, the Company is allowed to make provision for decline in value of
obsolete, damaged, and poor quality inventories and in cases where the cost of inventories is higher than
the net realizable value at the end of the accounting period.
7- Accounting principles and depreciation of fixed assets, finance leased fixed assets, investment
properties, construction in progress:
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation

The cost of tangible fixed assets includes the purchase price and all other costs directly related to
bringing the asset to a ready-to-use state.
The cost of self-made or self-constructed tangible fixed assets includes construction costs, actual
production costs incurred, plus installation and trial run costs.

Asset leasing
A lease is classified as a finance lease when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are
transferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The company recognizes leased assets as its own assets at the fair value of the leased asset at the
inception of the lease or at the present value of the minimum lease payments, if this value is lower. The
corresponding liability to the lessor is recognized on the balance sheet as a finance lease liability. Lease
payments are apportioned between finance costs and the reduction of the lease liability to ensure a
constant periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance lease costs are
recognized in the income statement unless these costs directly form the leased asset, in which case they
are capitalized according to the company's accounting policy on borrowing costs.
Finance leased assets are depreciated over the estimated useful life similar to the company's owned
assets, specifically as follows:

Construction in progress costs:
Assets under construction for production, rental, management, or any other purpose are recognized at
cost. This cost includes service costs and borrowing costs related in accordance with the company's
accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets is applied similarly to other assets, starting when the
asset is in a ready-to-use state.
8- Principles of accounting for deferred income tax:
Deferred income tax is calculated on the differences between the book value and the tax base of assets
or liabilities on the financial statements and is recognized using the balance sheet method. Deferred
income tax liabilities shall be recognized for all temporary differences, while deferred income tax assets
shall only be recognized when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the future
against which the temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred income tax is determined based on the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the
asset is recovered or the liability is settled. Deferred income tax is recognized in the income statement
and is only recorded in equity when the tax relates to items that are recorded directly in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities shall be offset when the Company has a
legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and
when the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by
the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current income tax assets and liabilities
on a net basis.

Other prepaid expenses include the value of small tools, instruments, and components that have been
issued for use and are considered likely to provide future economic benefits to the Company for a period
of one year or more. These expenses are capitalized as long-term prepayments and are allocated to the
income statement using the straight-line method in accordance with current accounting regulations.
10- Principles of accounting for payables:
Payables are recognized and presented on the financial statements when it is probable that the Company
will have to use an amount of money to cover the current obligations that the Company must pay and
that payable can be reliably determined.
Payables are tracked in detail according to payment term, payee, type of currency to be paid, and other
factors as required by the enterprise's management.
Other payables include payables that are non-commercial and not related to the purchase or sale, supply
of goods and services: payables related to financial expenses such as interest payable, dividends
payable, financial investment operating expenses payable; Non-commercial payables such as payables
for social insurance, health insurance, unemployment insurance, trade union funds,...
The accountant relies on the remaining term of the payables to classify them as long-term or short-term
when preparing the financial statements.
When there is evidence that a loss is likely to occur, the accountant immediately recognizes a payable in
accordance with the principle of prudence.
Payables that meet the definition of monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at
the end of the period when preparing the financial statements.
11- Principles of recognizing borrowings and financial lease liabilities:
The Company tracks the payment term details of borrowings and financial lease liabilities. Amounts
with a repayment period of more than 12 months from the financial statement date are presented as
long-term borrowings and financial lease liabilities. Amounts due within the next 12 months from the
financial statement date are presented as short-term borrowings and financial lease liabilities for
payment planning purposes.
For financial lease liabilities, the total lease debt reflects the total amount calculated at the present value
of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset.
Borrowing costs are recognized as production and business expenses in the year they are incurred,
unless they are capitalized in accordance with the Accounting Standard "Bon'owing Costs."
Accordingly, borrowing costs directly related to the purchase, construction, or production of assets that
require a relatively long time to complete and put into use or business are included in the original cost of
the asset until the asset is put into use or business. Income arising from the temporary investment of
loans is recorded as a reduction of the original cost of the related asset. For separate loans used for the
construction of fixed assets or investment properties, interest expenses are capitalized even if the
construction period is less than 12 months.
12- Principles for recognizing payables:

present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event; A decrease in economic benefits is
probable, leading to a requirement to settle the obligation; A reliable estimate can be made of the value
of the obligation.
The carrying amount of a provision for liabilities is the best estimate of the expenditure required to
settle the present obligation at the end of the accounting period.
Provisions for liabilities are made at the time of financial reporting. If the provision for liabilities to be
made in the current accounting period is greater than the provision for liabilities made in the previous
accounting period that has not been fully used, the difference is recognized in the production and
business expenses of that accounting period, and vice versa, if the provision for liabilities to be made in
the current accounting period is less than the provision for liabilities made in the previous accounting
period that has not been fully used, the difference must be reversed to reduce the production and
business expenses of that accounting period.
For provisions for liabilities for construction warranty, they are made for each construction project at the
time of recording the settlement of the construction project. If the provision for liabilities for
construction warranty is greater than the actual costs incurred, the difference is reversed into other
income.

severance allowance in accordance with the law; Provision for maintenance costs of apartment
buildings.
