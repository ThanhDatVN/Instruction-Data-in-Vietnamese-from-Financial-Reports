36 Explanation for the change by more than 10% in the 2nd quarter 2025 business results compared to the same period last year:
Profit after tax declined by nearly VND 84 billion (equivalent to a 95% decrease), mainly due to a reduction of approximately VND 89
billion in other income. The main reason is that in Quarter 2 in 2024, the Company recorded income from interest forgiveness of over
VND 92 billion, related to overdue interest on loans for newbuilding vessel projects financed by the Vietnam Development Bank.

4 Financial risk management:
Financial risk includes market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and cash flow risk. The Company does not implement measures to mitigate
these risks due to the lack of a market for purchasing such instruments.
Market risk: The Company purchases raw materials, goods, tools, and supplies from both domestic and foreign suppliers to support its
business operations. Therefore, the Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the prices of these materials, goods, tools, and
supplies. This risk is mitigated by sourcing from a diverse range of suppliers located in various countries and regions, as well as
maintaining flexibility in negotiating and adjusting sale prices to customers in response to significant price fluctuations in the market.
Credit risk: Consist of liquidity risk and interest rate risk: The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that funds are available to
meet current and future liabilities. The Company's policy is to regularly monitor the liquidity requirements for current and expected future
liabilities to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
