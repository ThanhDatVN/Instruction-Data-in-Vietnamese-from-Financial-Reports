The Company’s operation in the period that affects the Interim Separate Financial Statements:
In the first 6 months of 2025, the average selling price of rubber products increased due to rising demand in the global
market The Company implemented a strategic shift: sharply reducing the low-margin commercial business segment
and focusing on its own rubber tapping and processing activities.
Gross profit from the exploitation segment increased significantly, benefiting from high selling prices and reduced
costs (thanks to improved plantation productivity). As a result, despite a decrease in total revenue of VND 125.54
billion (a decrease of 41.48%), gross profit still increased by VND 2.76 billion (an increase of 15.85%) compared to
the same period last year.
Additionally, financial income also saw a sharp increase of VND 39.48 billion as the Company received dividends
from Tan Bien - Kampong Thom Rubber Joint Stock Company (a subsidiary). Furthermore, the market for wood
products is on the path to recovery, leading to higher income from the liquidation of rubber wood compared to the
same period last year, which caused other income to increase by VND 37.58 billion (an increase of 24.4%).
The combination of the aforementioned factors resulted in the Company's total net profit before tax increasing by VND
80.53 billion (an increase of 52.13%) compared to the same period last year.
