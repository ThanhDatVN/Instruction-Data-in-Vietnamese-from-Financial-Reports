INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
Re: Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024
To The Shareholders, (he Board of Directors and (he Board of Management
American Vietnamese Biotech Incorporation
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of American VictNamese Biotech Incorporation,
prepared on 28 May 2025 from page 07 to page 41, which comprise (he balance sheet as at 3 I December
2024, the income statement and cash How statement for the year then ended and the notes to the financial
statements.
flic Board of Management’s responsibility
Ilie Board of Management of American Vietnamese Biotech Incorporation is responsible for (he preparation
and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards,
Corporate Accounting System and legal regulations relating to preparation and presentation of financial
statements, and for such internal control as the Board of Management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that arc free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing. These standards require that we comply
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements arc free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and
fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of Management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
qualified audit opinion.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
- We were unable to observe the cash count as of December 31, 2024, for which the cash on hand was
VND 290,950,121, because we had not yet been appointed as the auditor at that time. Accordingly, we (Io
not express an opinion on the existence, accuracy, and completeness ofcash as of3 I December 2024.
- Certain associates have been established but have either not yet formed any assets or have formed
insignificant assets to support business operations. The total investment in these associates amounts to
VND 60,900,000,000 (as disclosed in Note V. 12b). Based on the audit procedures performed, we were
unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to assess the reasonableness of these investments or
their impact on the financial statements for the year 2024.
- The Company has invested in and installed machinery, equipment, and the medical image storage and
transmission software system (RJS-PACS) according to lease and cooperation agreements with hospitals
and medical centers. The total investment as of 31 December 2024, amounted to VND 80,255,898,895 (of

which VND 59,564,895,987 relates to assets handed over to hospitals lor use, and VND 20,691,002,908
relates to assets not yet handed over). Certain hospitals have generated revenue; however, due to the lack
of detailed and consistent guidance on payment for diagnostic imaging technical services based on (he
PACS system, the Company does not yet have sufficient reliable basis to fully determine (he economic
benefits arising from these leasing and cooperation arrangements. Nevertheless, (he Company has
recognized depreciation expense for the handed-over assets in (he operating results of the years, with
accumulated depreciation totaling VND 20,811,796,801 as of 31 December 2024 (of which VND
16,526,054,590 was accumulated as of 3 I December 2023, and VND 4,285,742,211 was depreciation
expense for year 2024). Based on the audit procedures performed, we were unable to determine the impact
of these matters on (he financial statements for the year ended 3 1 December 2024.
Qualified Opinion
In our opinion, except for the matters set forth in the “Basis for Qualified Opinion” paragraph, the
accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of, in all material respects, the financial
position of American Vietnamese Biotech Incorporation as at 3 I December 2024, and of the results of its
operations and its cash Hows for the year then ended in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards
and Corporate Accounting System and legal regulations relating to preparation and presentation of f
financial statements. I
Emphasis of Matter
As at 31 December 2024, the Company had an overdue loan with Viet Capital Commercial Joint Stock
Bank amounting to VND 24,625,095,827. As of the date of'this report, the loan remains overdue. The
Company had requested a loan extension through Official Letter No. 05/2024/CV-AMV for an extension
until October 2024, which was approved by BVBank under Official Letter No. 212/2024/BVbank/CV-
QL&THN dated 09 April 2024. However, as of the date of this report, (he Company has not fully repaid
the outstanding principal and is continuing to work with the bank to request a further extension. (Refer to
Note V. 17).
Other Matteis
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 of American Vietnamese Biotech
Incorporation were audited by another audit firm. Independent Auditor’s Report No. 201/BCKT-TC dated 29
March 2024 expressed a qualified opinion due to the auditors’ inability to estimate the net realizable value of ,,
inventories comprising various types of software, which were presented at historical cost and amounted to
VND 140,080,690,416 as at 31 December 2023. As of the date of this report, all of the aforementioned
software had been sold and the related receivables had been fully collected. Therefore, this matter no longer
affects the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.
In addition, the Independent Auditor’s Report for the year 2023 included an Emphasis of Matter paragraph
regarding the following matters:
+ The Company has invested in and installed machinery, equipment, and the medical image storage and
transmission software system (R1S-PACS) according to cooperation agreements with hospitals and
medical centers but has not yet recognized revenue from these activities. Phis matter has been included in
the Basis for Qualified Opinion section of our report.
+ The loan from Viet Capital Commercial Joint Stock Bank as of 31 December 2023 amounted to VND
3 1,623,165,292 and was overdue. We continue to emphasize this matter in our 2024 audit report.
