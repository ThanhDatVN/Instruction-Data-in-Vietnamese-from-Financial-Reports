Tangible fixed assets are stated at original cost less (-) accumulated depreciation. The initial cost of a tangible fixed asset
comprises all expenditures of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. The
expenditures incurred after initial recognition are capitalised as an additional cost of tangible fixed assets when they have
resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of those tangible fixed assets.
The expenditures which do not meet the above conditions are charged to the expenses in the year.
When the assets are sold or disposed, their original costs and the accumulated depreciation which have been written off

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the quarter 1 of2025 Unit: VND
4.3 Method of depreciating and amortizing fixed assets
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of fixed assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Useful life means the duration in which the tangible fixed assets produce their effect on production and business.
The estimated useful life for assets is as follows:
Buildings and structures 25 - 50 years
Transportation and facilities 10 years
Machinery and equipment 03 years
Intangible fixed assets 05 years
Computer software 08 years
Land use rights which are granted for an indefinite term are carried at cost and not amortised.
5. Principles for recording construction in progress: *
Construction in progress is stated at original cost. This cost includes all necessary costs for purchasing new fixed assets, t

finalized, the asset will be handed over and put into use.
6. Principles for recording and depreciating investment properties
Principles for recording investment properties: Investment properties are stated at cost less (-) accumulated depreciation.
The original cost of an investment property comprises all expenditures in cash or cash equivalents or the fair value of the
amounts payable to have the investment properties to the date of purchase or completion.
The original cost of a purchased investment property comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable
expenditure includes: professional fees for legal services, registration tax and other related expenses.
Expenditures incurred after the initial recognization are recorded as expenses in the period, except for the case where it
can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditures have resulted in future economic benefits in excess of the originally
assessed standard of performance of the existing investment property, the expenditures are capitalised as an additional
cost of investment property.
When investment properties are sold, the original cost and accumulated depreciation are written off and any gain or loss
resulting from the sales of these properties will be recorded into the income statement in the period.
The Group does not make depreciation for the investment properties awaiting price increase. In case where there are
reliable evidence showing that the investment properties have devalued in comparison with the market value and the
devaluated amount has been reliably determined, then the Group will valuate the decrease of the investment property's
original cost and record the loss in cost of goods sold. When the investment property increases, the Group will reverse
maximum value equal to the previously decreased amount.
7. Principles for recording business cooperation contract (BCC)
The Group initially records amounts contributed to BCC at original cost and reflects as other liabilities.
BCC in the form of jointly controlled operations is a joint-venture which does not require establishment of new business
entity. Ventures shall fulfill obligations and exercise rights according to the BCC. The joint-venture activities may be
carried out alongside other ordinary actitivies of each venture.
Equities (monetary or non-monetary assets) contributed in BCC and recorded in the financial statements are contributed
assets in joint ventures based on the contract. The differences between the fair value of the received assets and the value
of contributed capital (if any) are refelected as other income or other expenses.
If the BCC stipulates that other parties in the BCC can only share profits if the BCC's operating results are profitable, and
must bear losses, the Group records the revenue and expenses corresponding to its share from the BCC.

service, services provided; 2. The enterprise has or will gain economic benefits from the transaction providing that
service; 3. Determine the work completed on the balance sheet date; 4. Determine the costs incurred for the transaction
and the cost of completing the transaction to provide that service.
If the outcome of a contract cannot be measured reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of the expenses
recognised that are recoverable.

In case the business cooperation contract stipulates the division of cooperation results by profit after corporate income
tax with the condition that the profit divided among the parties does not perform accounting and does not settle taxes

the deferred income tax payable in the year and reversing the deferred income tax being recorded from prior years. The
Group does not record in this account the deferred income tax assets or deferred income tax liabilities arising from the
transactions being recorded directly in the owners' equity.

payable in the, year and reversing the deferred income tax being recorded from prior years.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset when the Group has the legal right to offset
current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income tax assets and deferred income
tax liabilities are relevant to corporate income tax which is under the management of one tax authority of the same
subject to corporate income tax and the Group has intention to pay current income tax liabilities and current income tax
assets on a net basis.
The tax amounts payable to the State budget will be finalized with the tax office. Differences between the tax amounts
payable specified in the book and the tax amounts under finalization will be adjusted when the tax finalization has been
issued by the tax office.
Due to the uncertainty of future taxable profits, the Group has not recognised deferred tax assets for unused tax losses.
The Group's current corporate income tax rate for other activities is 20%.

Basic earnings per share are calculated by taking the profit or loss allocated to shareholders who own common shares of
the Group after deducting the Bonus and Welfare Fund appropriated during the period and dividing it by the average
amount, weighted number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the after-tax profit or loss attributable to shareholders holding
ordinary shares of the Group (after adjusting for dividends on convertible preferred shares), for the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period and the weighted average number of common shares that would
be issued in the event that all potential common shares are dilutive. Discounts are converted into common shares.

VND 30,000,000,000 to the contributing party upon the completion of this investment cooperation agreement.
Currently, this project has not met the conditions to apply for a sales license, so the real estate products have not been

cooperation results based on cooperative revenue (before CIT). The project developer has met the conditions to raise
funds through the sale of future real estate. However, the successfully transacted products have not yet reached the
sales ratio as agreed in the contract, so no cooperation revenue has been recognized.
