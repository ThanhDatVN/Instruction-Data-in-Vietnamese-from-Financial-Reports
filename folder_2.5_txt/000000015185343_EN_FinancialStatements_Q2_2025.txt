statements:
8EASTERNS AHP MINERALS JOINT STOCK COMPANY
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form No. B09 - DN
These explanatory notes are an integral part and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
financial statements
4.1. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
The financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis (except for some information related to
cash flow), using the historical cost principle, based on the assumption of going concern.
4.2. Accounting estimate
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the
enterprise accounting system, and relevant legal regulations requires the CEO of the Company to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported figures for liabilities, assets, and the
presentation of potential liabilities and assets as of the financial statement date, as well as the revenue
and expense figures throughout the financial year. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates and
assumptions made.
4.3. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash reflects the total amount of money the Company has at the end of the accounting period,
including cash, demand deposits, and cash in transit.
Cash equivalents reflect short-term investments with a maturity period not exceeding 3 months from
the date of investment, which are easily convertible into a known amount of cash and are not subject to
significant risk of changes in value at the reporting date. These are recognized in accordance with the
provisions of Vietnam Accounting Standard No. 24 - Statement of Cash Flows.
4.4. Investments Held to Maturity
This category reflects investments that the Company intends and has the ability to hold until maturity,
with remaining maturities of no more than 12 months (short-term) and over 12 months (long-term) from
the reporting date (excluding trading securities), including: term deposits in banks (including certificates
of deposit and promissory notes) with the purpose of earning interest periodically.
Investments held to maturity are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price and
transaction costs related to the acquisition, such as brokerage fees, transaction fees, consulting fees,
taxes, levies, and bank charges. After initial recognition, these investments are recorded at their
recoverable value.
Interest earned from these investments after the purchase date, as well as gains from the liquidation or
sale of these investments, are recognized in financial income. Any interest accrued before the
Company holds the investment is deducted from the initial purchase cost.
The Company classifies investments held to maturity as either short-term or long-term based on the
remaining term from the reporting date. When there is evidence indicating that part or all of an
investment may not be recoverable and the loss can be reliably measured, the loss is recognized as a
financial expense for the year and directly deducted from the investment value. Provision for
investments held to maturity is made similarly to provisions for doubtful receivables, as described in
Note 4.7.
4.5. Loans
This category reflects loans granted through contracts or agreements between the parties, with
remaining terms to maturity of no more than 12 months (short-term) and over 12 months (long-term) at
the reporting date. Loans are recorded at cost. Interest on loans is recognized in financial income when
incurred.
The Company classifies loans as either short-term or long-term based on the remaining term from the
reporting date and reevaluates foreign currency-denominated monetary items (if applicable).
Provision for loans is made similarly to provisions for doubtful receivables, as described in Note 4.6.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form No. B09 - DN
These explanatory notes are an integral part and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
financial statements
4.6. Investments in Other Entities
Investment in associates
Reflecting investments that the company holds directly or indirectly from 20% to less than 50% of the
voting rights of the investee (associated company) without any other agreements.
An associated company is a business in which the company has significant influence but not control
over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is demonstrated by the right to participate
in decisions regarding the financial and operating policies of the investee but without controlling these
policies.
Investment in other entities
These are investments in equity instruments where the company does not have control, joint control, or
significant influence over the investee.
Equity investments in other entities are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price or
capital contribution plus any directly related costs such as brokerage fees, transaction fees,
consultancy, audit fees, taxes, and banking charges, if applicable. In the case of an investment made
using non-monetary assets, the cost of the investment is recognized based on the fair value of the non­
monetary asset at the time of occurrence.
Dividends and profits from periods before the investment was acquired are deducted from the value of
the investment itself. Dividends and profits from periods after the investment is acquired are
recognized as financial income at their fair value on the date the right to receive them is established.
For dividends received in the form of shares, the company only tracks the increase in the number of
shares in the financial statement notes and does not recognize an increase in the investment value or
financial income.
Provision for losses on other equity investments is the difference between the cost and market value of
the investment, or the portion of the company’s ownership as per the investee’s accounting records,
and is made in accordance with the current enterprise accounting system.
4.7. Receivables and Provision for Doubtful Receivables
Receivables are tracked in detail by their original maturity, remaining maturity at the reporting date, the
entity owing the receivable, the type of currency receivable, and other factors as required by the
Company’s management. Receivables are classified as trade receivables or other receivables
according to the following principles:
- Trade receivables include amounts due from transactions involving the sale and purchase of goods,
including amounts due from sales of goods or from export transactions entrusted to other entities.
- Other receivables include non-trade amounts not related to sales and purchases, such as: interest
receivables from loans, bank deposits; amounts paid on behalf of others; receivables from export
trust transactions: receivables from fines, penalties, compensation; advances; pledged, deposited,
or escrowed amounts, and loans of assets, etc.
Receivables are recognized at amounts that do not exceed their recoverable value. A provision for
doubtful receivables is made for receivables that are overdue by more than six months or those for
which the debtor is unlikely to settle due to dissolution, bankruptcy, or similar difficulties, in accordance
with the current accounting system for enterprises.
4.8. Inventories
Ordinary inventory
Inventory is determined based on the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventory
includes purchase costs, processing costs, and other directly related costs incurred to bring the
inventory to its present location and condition. The cost of inventory is determined using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price less the
estimated costs to complete and the estimated costs necessary to sell the inventory.
10EASTERNS AHP MINERALS JOINT STOCK COMPANY
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form No. B09 - DN
These explanatory notes are an integral part and should be read In conjunction with the accompanying
financial statements
Inventory is accounted for using the perpetual inventory method
Real estate inventory
Real estate purchased or constructed for sale or long-term lease, which meets the conditions for
revenue recognition during the ordinary course of the Company's operations, and is not held for rental
or awaiting appreciation, is recognized as inventory at the lower of cost to bring each product to its
current location and condition, or its net realizable value.
The cost of real estate inventory includes land use rights, land lease payments, and other taxes,
construction costs paid to contractors, and related expenses such as interest costs, design
consultancy fees, land leveling costs, compensation for land clearance, general .construction
management costs, and other related expenses.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of the inventory under normal business conditions,
based on market value at the reporting date, less estimated costs to complete and estimated selling
expenses. .
Provision for inventory impairment
Provision for inventory impairment is the difference between the cost of inventory and its net realizable
value at the end of the financial year. This provision is made in accordance with the current enterprise
accounting system regulations.
4.9. Tangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation j
Tangible fixed assets are presented at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of tangible fixed
assets is determined based on the historical cost.
The cost of tangible fixed assets formed from purchases and transferred construction includes the
purchase price and all other costs directly related to bringing the asset into a condition ready for use.
The cost of tangible fixed assets constructed by the company includes construction costs, actual
production costs incurred, as well as installation and trial run costs.
Subsequent costs are added to the asset's original cost if they truly improve the asset’s current
condition compared to its original standard condition, such as:
Replacing parts of the tangible fixed asset that increase its useful life or enhance its capacity;
Improving parts of the tangible fixed asset that significantly improve the quality of the produced
goods;
Implementing a new manufacturing technology process that reduces the asset's operating
costs compared to before.
Costs incurred for repairs and maintenance aimed at restoring or maintaining the asset's ability to
generate economic benefits in line with its original operational condition, which do not meet any of the
above conditions, are recorded as expenses in the production and business costs for the year.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life, in
accordance with the provisions of Circular 45/2013/TT-BTC dated April 25, 2013, amended by Circular
147/2016/TT-BTC dated October 13, 2016, and Circular 28/2017/TT-BTC dated April 12, 2017, which
provides guidance on the management, use, and depreciation of fixed assets, as follows:
Asset Type Year
Buildings and structures 05-11
Machinery and equipment 05-12
Transport vehicles and communication equipment 06-10
Management tools and devices 03 - 05
11EASTERNS AHP MINERALS JOINT STOCK COMPANY
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form No. B09 - DN
These explanatory notes are an integral part and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
financial statements
Gains or losses arising from the disposal or sale of assets are the difference between the income from
the disposal and the remaining value of the asset, and are recognized in the Income Statement.
4.10. Intangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Intangible fixed assets are presented at cost less accumulated amortization. The cost of intangible
fixed assets is determined based on their acquisition cost.
The Company’s intangible fixed assets are computer software programs, which are amortized using
the straight-line method over an 8-year period.
4.11. Finance Leases
A lease is classified as a finance lease when the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership of the •
asset are transferred to the lessee. Ownership of the asset may transfer at the end of the lease term.
The Company recognizes the cost of the leased asset as the Company's asset, recorded at the fair
value of the leased asset at the lease commencement date, or at the present value of the minimum
lease payments (if lower than the fair value), plus any directly attributable initial costs related to the
finance lease transaction. The corresponding lease liability is recognized on the balance sheet as a
financial lease payable. Lease payments are allocated between financial costs and principal repayment
to ensure a fixed interest rate on the remaining liability. Financial lease costs are recognized in the
income statement, unless these costs directly contribute to the creation of the leased asset, in which
case they are capitalized under the Company’s policy on borrowing costs.
The finance lease fixed asset is depreciated using the straight-line method based on the estimated
useful life, in accordance with the regulations in Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC of the Ministry of
Finance on the management, use, and depreciation of fixed assets.
The Company’s finance lease fixed asset is a stone crushing plant with a capacity of 400 tons/hour,
depreciated over 12 years.
4.12. Investment Properties
The Company’s investment properties consist of 3 houses located at UNI-TOWN Commercial District,
the Industrial-Service-Urban Complex of Binh Duong, which are owned by the Company and are held
for the purpose of earning profits from potential capital appreciation.
Investment properties held for capital appreciation are presented at cost less impairment losses. The
cost of investment properties includes all cash or cash-equivalent expenses incurred by the company
or the fair value of other exchanges made to acquire the investment property, up to the point of
purchase or completion of construction.
Costs related to investment properties that arise after initial recognition are recognized as expenses,
unless these costs are certain to increase future economic benefits from the investment property, in
which case they are added to the cost of the asset.
Investment properties held for capital appreciation are not depreciated. If there is clear evidence that
an investment property has decreased in value compared to its market value, and the impairment loss
can be reliably measured, the investment property’s cost is reduced, and the loss is recognized in the
cost of goods sold.
4.13. Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses include costs that have been incurred but relate to activities expected to benefit
multiple accounting periods. Prepaid expenses include: consulting fees, exploration costs for rock
reserves, the value of tools and equipment used, and other costs deemed likely to provide future
economic benefits to the Company. These include:
- Mining rights fees: The mining rights fees are determined based on the amount paid under the
decision approving the mining rights fee for the Rach Rat quarry, An Binh Commune, Phu Giao
District, Binh Duong Province, Decision No. 1782/QD-UBND dated June 21, 2019, by the People's
Committee of Binh Duong Province. These fees are allocated over the life of the mining license.
12EASTERNS AHP MINERALS JOINT STOCK COMPANY
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form No. B09 - DN
These explanatory notes are an integral part and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
financial statements
- The value of tools and equipment used by the Company is amortized using the straight-line method
over a maximum period of 1 year (short-term prepaid expenses) and not exceeding 3 years (long­
term prepaid expenses).
4.14. Payables
Payables are monitored in detail according to their original maturity, remaining maturity at the reporting
date, payee, currency of the payable, and other factors as required by the Company's management.
Payables are classified as payables to suppliers, accrued expenses, and other payables according to
the following principles:
- Payables to suppliers nclude amounts owed arising from commercial transactions related to buying
and selling, including payables for imports through agents.;
- Other payables include amounts owed that are not related to commercial transactions involving the
sale or provision of goods and services, such as: Payables for interest on loans; Dividends and
profits payable; Payables related to financial investment activities; Payables due to third parties on
behalf of the company; Payables for fines and compensation; Payables for assets identified as
surplus with unclear cause; Payables for social insurance, health insurance, unemployment
insurance, and trade union fees; Payables for deposits and collateral, etc.
Payables are recognized at no less than the obligation to be settled. When there is evidence indicating
that a loss is likely to occur, the company immediately recognizes a liability based on the principle of
prudence. J
4.15. Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities
The Company's borrowings and finance lease liabilities include loans and finance lease obligations.
Loans and finance lease liabilities are tracked in detail by borrower, lender, loan contract, type of loan
or lease, and maturity period. Borrowings and finance lease liabilities with remaining repayment terms
of more than 12 months from the reporting date are classified as “Long-term borrowings and finance
lease liabilities.” Borrowings and finance lease liabilities due within 12 months from the reporting date
are classified as “Short-term borrowings and finance lease liabilities.”.
4.16. Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs include interest on loans and other costs directly related to the borrowings.
Borrowing costs are recognized as production and operating expenses in the year incurred, except
for borrowing costs directly related to the investment, construction, or production of assets under
development that require a sufficiently long period (over 12 months) to be ready for their intended use
or sale. These costs are capitalized as part of the asset’s value when the conditions specified in
Vietnam Accounting Standard No. 16 - Borrowing Costs are met. For loans specifically for the
construction of fixed assets, interest is capitalized even if the construction period is 12 months or less.
For general borrowings, including those used for investment in construction or the production of assets
under development, the capitalized borrowing costs are determined based on the capitalization rate,
which is applied to the weighted average accumulated costs incurred for the construction or production
of that asset.
The capitalization rate is calculated using the weighted average interest rate of the borrowings
outstanding during the year, excluding loans specifically related to the creation of a particular asset.
4.17. Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses are recognized based on reasonable estimates of amounts due for goods and
services used during the year but for which invoices have not been received or accounting
documentation is incomplete. This includes interest expenses and certain other costs.

4.18. Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when the outcome of a transaction can be reliably measured, and the Company
has the ability to receive economic benefits from the transaction.
Revenue from sales of goods is recognized when the following conditions are met:
- The Company has transferred the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to
the buyer;
- The Company no longer retains control of the goods as owner or has no authority over them;
- Revenue can be measured reliably. If the contract allows the buyer the right to return the purchased
goods under specific conditions, the Company recognizes revenue only when those conditions no
longer exist and the buyer no longer has the right to return the goods (except when the buyer has
the right to exchange goods for other products or services);
- The Company has or will receive economic benefits from the sale transaction;
- The costs related to the sale transaction can be determined.
/
Revenue from providing services is recognized when the following conditions are met: r

purchased service under specific conditions, the Company recognizes revenue only when those
conditions no longer exist and the buyer no longer has the right to return the service provided;
- The Company has or will receive economic benefits from providing the service. J
- The portion of work completed as of the reporting date can be determined.
- The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the service transaction can be
determined.
Revenue from Construction Contracts:
Construction contracts specify that the contractor is paid based on the value of the work completed.
When the results of the construction contract are reliably determined and confirmed by the customer,
the revenue and costs related to the contract are recognized corresponding to the portion of the work
completed, as verified by the customer within the period.
Revenue from Sale of Real Estate is recognized when the following conditions are met:
- The real estate has been fully completed and handed over to the buyer, and the Company has
transferred the risks and rewards of ownership of the real estate to the buyer;
- The Company no longer retains control over the real estate as the owner or has authority over it;
- The revenue can be reliably measured;
- The Company has received or will receive economic benefits from the real estate sale transaction;
- The costs related to the real estate sale transaction can be determined.
Financial Income interest on deposits, loans; dividends, profits received; discounts on payments, and
other financial income.
Other Income reflects income arising from events or transactions outside the Company’s normal
business operations, excluding the revenue mentioned above.
4.19. Taxes
Corporate income tax includes current income tax and deferred income tax.
Current income tax expense reflects the amount of corporate income tax payable for the year, as well
as any additional income tax payable due to the discovery of immaterial errors from previous years.
Current income tax income reflects the reduction in income tax payable due to the discovery of
immaterial errors from previous years.
14EASTERNS AHP MINERALS JOINT STOCK COMPANY
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form No. B09 - DN
These explanatory notes are an integral part and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
financial statements
Deferred income tax expense reflects the difference between deferred income tax assets realized
during the year that exceed the deferred income tax assets arising in the year, or deferred income tax
liabilities that exceed deferred income tax liabilities realized during the year. Deferred income tax
income reflects the difference between deferred income tax assets arising in the year that exceed
deferred income tax assets realized during the year, or deferred income tax liabilities that exceed
deferred income tax liabilities realized during the year.
Deferred income tax is calculated based on the differences between the carrying amount and the tax
base of assets or liabilities on the financial statements, taxable losses, and unused tax credits.
Deferred income tax liabilities must be recognized for all temporary differences, while deferred income
tax assets are only recognized when there is reasonable certainty of sufficient taxable income in the
future to offset those temporary differences.
Deferred income tax is calculated based on the tax rates expected to be applicable to the year in which
the asset is recovered or the liability is settled. Deferred income tax is recognized in the income
statement, unless the tax is related to items directly recognized in equity, in which case the deferred
income tax is also recognized in equity. •.
J
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Company has a legal right to offset
current income tax assets with current income tax liabilities, and when the deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are related to income tax in the same jurisdiction and the Company intends to settle the
current income tax on a net basis. t
Taxable income may differ from the total accounting profit before tax presented in the income
statement because taxable income does not include taxable income or deductible expenses from other i
years (including carried-forward losses, if any). It also excludes tax-exempt income or non-deductible
expenses.
The determination of the Company’s income tax is based on the current tax regulations. However,
these regulations change over time, and the determination of corporate income tax obligations
depends on the results of audits by the competent tax authorities.
Other taxes are applied in accordance with the current tax laws in Vietnam.
4.20. Financial Instruments
Initial Recognition
Financial Assets
According to Circular No. 210/2009/TT-BTC dated November 6, 2009, issued by the Ministry of
