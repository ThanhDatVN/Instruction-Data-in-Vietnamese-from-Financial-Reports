17 Profit after corporate income tax 153.281.662.709 64.001.910.370 89.279.752.339 139,5%Accounting profit after corporate income tax in the second quarter of 2025 was VND 153,281
million, an increase of VND 89,279 million compared to the same period last year, equivalent to an increase
of 139.5%, due to:
- Net revenue from sales and service provision this period increased by VND 664,513 million,
equivalent to an increase of 71.0% compared to the same period last year. The increase in revenue was
mainly due to the rise in sales volume and the average selling price this period compared to the same period
last year (the average selling price this period was VND 16.24 million/ton, an increase of VND 3.56
million/ton compared to the same period last year; DAP consumption output increased by 2,666 tons,
equivalent to an increase of 3.7% over the same period last year). In addition, this period recorded a
significant increase in revenue from the sale of Ammonia compared to the same period last year (an increase
of VND 362,137 million).
- Cost of goods sold this period increased by VND 536,554 million compared with the same period
last year, equivalent to a 65.0% rise. The increase was driven by the higher sales volume analyzed above
and by rising input material prices.
- Financial revenue this period increased by VND 7,893 million compared to the same period last
year, mainly due to income from interest on term deposits at banks and foreign exchange rate differences.
- Financial expenses this period increased by VND 846 million, equivalent to a 93.5%o rise compared
to the same period last year. The increase in financial expenses was mainly due to losses from foreign
exchange rate differences and payment discounts incurred during the period.
- Selling expenses this period increased by VND 8,752 million, equivalent to a 46.4% rise compared
to the same period last year.
- General administrative expenses this period increased by VND 14,463 million, equivalent to a
52.5%o rise compared to the same period last year.
Thus, in the second quarter of 2025, both revenue and expenses related to production and business
activities increased compared to the same period last year. However, the rate of increase in revenue was
higher than the rate of increase in expenses, resulting in an increase in both pre-tax and post-tax profit
compared to the same period last year.
The above is the Company’s explanation regarding the change of 10% or more in profit after
corporate income tax in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year. We hereby
confirm that the information disclosed above is true and we take full responsibility before the law for the
content of the disclosed information.

The Company has not assessed the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities at the balance sheet date
because Circular No. 210/2009/TT-BTC dated November 6, 2009 and current regulations do not provide specific
guidance on determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities. Circular 210 requires the
application of International Financial Reporting Standards on the presentation of financial statements and disclosure
of information for financial instruments but does not provide equivalent guidance for the measurement and
recognition of financial instruments, including the application of fair value, in order to comply with International
Financial Risk Management Objectives
The Company has established a risk management system to identify and assess the risks to which the Company is
exposed, and to establish policies and procedures to control risks at an acceptable level. The risk management system
is reviewed periodically to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's operations.
Financial risks include market risk (including exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and
liquidity risk.Market Risk
The Company does not hedge these risks after the Board of Directors has assessed that the cost of hedging exchange
rate risk or interest rate risk may be higher than the cost arising from market risk if there is a change in the exchange
rate of these financial instruments in the future.
Exchange rate risk management
The Company conducts a number of transactions denominated in foreign currencies, accordingly, the Company will
Interest rate risk management
The Company bears interest rate risk arising from the signed interest-bearing loans. This risk will be managed by the
Company by maintaining a reasonable level of loans and analyzing the competitive situation in the market to obtain
favorable interest rates for the Company from appropriate lending sources.
Price risk management
The Company bears the price risk of equity instruments arising from investments in equity instruments. Investments
in equity instruments are held for long-term strategic purposes rather than for trading purposes. The Company has no
intention of selling these investments.
Credit Risk
Credit risk occurs when a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, resulting in a financial
loss to the Company. The Company has a credit policy in place and regularly monitors the situation to assess whether
the Company is exposed to credit risk.
Liquidity Risk Management
The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient funds to meet current and future
financial obligations. Liquidity is also managed by the Company to ensure that the excess of liabilities due over
assets due during the year is at a manageable level relative to the amount of funds the Company believes can be
generated during the year. The Company's policy is to regularly monitor current and expected future liquidity
requirements to ensure that the Company maintains adequate reserves of cash, borrowings and capital committed by
its owners to meet its short-term and longer-term liquidity requirements.
The table below details the remaining contractual maturities for non-derivative financial liabilities and their agreed
repayment terms. The table is presented based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the
earliest date the Company can be required to pay. The table presents cash flows of principal and interest. The
contractual maturity dates are based on the earliest date the Company can be required to pay.
