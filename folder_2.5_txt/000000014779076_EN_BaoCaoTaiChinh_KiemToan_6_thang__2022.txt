The auditors have discussed with the Company's management the inappropriateness of using the going
concern assumption and have requested management to assess or further evaluate the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. However, the management has affirmed that there are no plans to
discontinue the Company’s operations in the coming year. Therefore, the Company's interim
consolidated financial statements have still been prepared based on the going concern assumption.

opinion," we were unable to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence to form a basis for a
conclusion. Therefore, we are unable to express a conclusion on the attached interim financial
statements.

easily convertible into a fixed amount of cash, and with no significant risk of conversion.
3. Financial investments
Loans
Loans are recognized at their original cost, less any provision for doubtful receivables. The
provision for doubtful receivables on loans is established based on the estimated level of potential
loss.
Investments in associated companies
Associated companies
An associate company is an enterprise in which the Company has significant influence but does
not have control over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is reflected in the
right to participate in making decisions on the financial and operating policies of the investee, but
without controlling these policies.
Investments in associated companies are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price
or capital contribution plus directly attributable costs related to the investment. In the case of o \
investments in non-monetary assets, the investment amount is recognized at the fair value of the m
non-monetary asset at the time the investment is made. 7
Dividends and profits from periods before the investment was acquired are accounted for as a
reduction in the value of the investment itself. Dividends and profits from periods after the
investment is acquired are recognized as revenue. Stock dividends received are only tracked as an
increase in the number of shares, without recognizing the value of the shares received / recorded at
par value.
Investments in equity instruments of other entities
Investments in equity instruments of other entities include investments in equity instruments where
the Company does not have control, joint control, or significant influence over the investee.
Investments in equity instruments of other entities are initially recognized at cost, including the
purchase price or capital contribution plus any directly attributable costs related to the investment
activity. Dividends and profits from periods before the investment is acquired are accounted for as
a reduction in the value of the investment itself. Dividends and profits from periods after the
investment is acquired are recognized as revenue. Stock dividends received are only tracked as an
increase in the number of shares, without recognizing the value of the shares received / recorded at
par value (except for state-owned companies, which follow the current legal regulations).

4. Inventory recognition principles
Inventories arc recognized al the lower of cost and net realizable value.
The cost of inventories is determined as follows:
• Raw materials, goods: include purchase costs and other directly attributable costs incurred to
bring the inventory to its current location and condition.
• Finished goods include the cost of raw materials, direct labor, and related manufacturing
overhead allocated based on normal operating capacity, as well as land use right costs, direct
costs, and related overhead incurred during the investment and construction of real estate
finished goods.
• Work-in-progress production costs: only include the cost of main raw materials (or other
relevant cost elements as appropriate).
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventory in the normal course of production
and business operations, minus the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary
to sell them.
The value of inventory is determined using the weighted average method and is accounted for
using the perpetual inventory system.
Inventory write-downs are made at the end of the year when there is a decline in the net realizable
value of inventory compared to its cost.
5. Receivables
Receivables are presented at their carrying amount, net of any allowance for doubtful debts.
The classification of receivables into customer receivables and other receivables is carried out
according to the following principles:
• Customer receivables reflect trade-related receivables arising from purchase-sale transactions
between the company and buyers who are independent entities from the parent company,
including receivables from entrusted export sales to other entities.
• Other receivables reflect non-trade receivables that are not related to purchase-sale transactions.
• A provision for doubtful debts is established for each doubtful receivable based on the overdue
age of the debts or the estimated potential loss, as specified below:
• For overdue receivables:
- 30% of the value for receivables overdue from 6 months to less than 1 year.
- 50% of the value for receivables overdue from 1 year to less than 2 years. /cc
cc
- 70% of the value for receivables overdue from 2 years to less than 3 years.
- 100% of the value for receivables overdue for 3 years or more. \DA
• For receivables that are not yet overdue but are unlikely to be recovered: the provision is
established based on the estimated potential loss.
6. Recognition and depreciation principles for fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of fixed assets includes all
expenses incurred by the Company to acquire the asset and bring it into a condition ready for use.
Subsequent costs are added to the cost of the fixed asset only if these costs are expected to result in
future economic benefits from using the asset. Costs that do not meet this condition are
immediately recognized as expenses.
When a fixed asset is sold or disposed of, its cost and accumulated depreciation are written off,
and any gain or loss arising from the disposal is recognized in income or expense for the year,

investment properties includes all expenses incurred by the Company or the fair value of assets
exchanged to acquire the investment property up to the point of purchase or the completion of
construction.

Costs related to investment properties incurred after initial recognition are recognized as expenses,
unless these costs are likely to result in the investment property generating future economic
benefits exceeding the initial assessed level of activity, in which case they arc added to the cost of
the property.

services that have been received. Accrued expenses are recognized based on reasonable estimates
í of the amounts payable.

Note to the financial statements (coni)
It is probable that economic benefits will be obtained from the transaction;
Revenue is determined with reasonable certainty./.
12. Accounting Principle for Cost of Goods Sold
The cost of goods sold during the year is recognized in accordance with the revenue generated
during the period and ensures compliance with the prudence principle. 12:
For direct material costs that exceed normal consumption, labor costs, and fixed production ¡^
overheads that are not allocated to the value of goods in inventory, accounting must immediately |q
include them in the cost of goods sold (after deducting any compensation, if applicable), even j^.
when the products or goods have not been recognized as sold.
The provision for inventory write-down is included in the cost of goods sold based on the quantity ^Jj
of inventory and the difference between the net realizable value and the original cost of the
inventory. When determining the volume of inventory to be written down, accounting must
exclude inventory that has been contracted for sale (with a net realizable value not lower than its
carrying value) but has not yet been transferred to the customer, if there is reliable evidence that
the customer will not withdraw from fulfilling the contract. ।
13. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs include interest on loans and other costs directly related to the borrowing.
Borrowing costs are recognized as expenses when incurred. If the borrowing costs are directly
related to the construction or production of assets that are under construction and require a
significant period (over 12 months) to be ready for use or sale, those borrowing costs are
capitalized. For Ioans specifically used for the construction of fixed assets or investment
properties, interest is capitalized even if the construction period is less than 12 months. Any
income generated from the temporary investment of the loan funds is deducted from the carrying
amount of the related asset.
For general loans that are used for the purpose of investing in the construction or production of
work-in-progress assets, the capitalized borrowing costs are determined based on a capitalization
rate applied to the weighted average accumulated costs incurred for the construction or production
of that asset. The capitalization rate is calculated based on the weighted average interest rate of the
loans that remain unpaid during the year, excluding specific loans used for the purpose of forming
a particular asset. ~
14. Accounting principles for selling expenses and administrative expenses T
Selling expenses reflect the actual costs incurred during the process of selling products, goods, or A
providing services, including costs for offering, product promotion, advertising, sales )i
commissions, product warranty costs (excluding construction activities), storage, packaging, and )j
transportation costs...
Administrative expenses reflect the general management costs of the company, including expenses
for the salaries of company management staff (wages, salaries, allowances, etc.); social insurance,
health insurance, trade union funds, and unemployment insurance for the company’s management
staff; office materials, labor tools, and depreciation of fixed assets used for company management;
land rent, business license tax; provisions for doubtful accounts receivable; outsourced services

dcducliblc expenses, as well as adjustments for income that is exempt from tax and carried-
forward losses.

16. Financial assets
Classification of Financial Assets
The company classifies financial assets into the following categories: financial assets measured at ^N
fair value through profit or loss, hcld-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables, and '¿r
available-for-sale financial assets. The classification of these financial assets depends on the nature
and purpose of the financial asset and is determined at the time of initial recognition. ^
Financial assets are recognized at fair value through the income statement
Financial assets are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss if they are held for
trading or arc designated as fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition.
Financial assets are classified as held-for-trading securities if:
• Purchased or created primarily for the purpose of selling in the short term;
• The company intends to hold them for the purpose of short-term profit;
• Derivative financial instruments (except for derivative financial instruments designated
as a financial guarantee contract or an effective hedging instrument).
Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments arc non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and a fixed maturity date that the company intends and has the ability to hold until
maturity.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that
are not listed on the market.
Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as
available for sale or are not classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or
loss, held-to-maturity investments, or loans and receivables.
The initial carrying amount of a financial asset
Financial assets are recognized on the purchase date and derecognized on the sale date. At the
initial recognition, the financial asset is determined at the purchase price/issuance cost plus any
other costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of the financial asset.
17. Financial liabilities and equity instruments V
Financial instruments are classified as financial liabilities or equity instruments at the time of
initial recognition in accordance with the nature and definition of financial liabilities and equity
instruments.
Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are recognized at fair value through the income statement
Financial liabilities arc classified as recognized al fair value through the income statement if they
arc held for trading or arc designated as al fair value through the income statement at (he time of
initial recognition.
Financial liabilities are classified as hcld-for-trading securities if:
• Issued or created primarily for the purpose of repurchasing in the short term;
• The company intends to hold them for the purpose of short-term profit;
• Derivative financial instruments (except for derivative financial instruments designated
as a financial guarantee contract or an effective hedging instrument).
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are determined by the initial carrying amount of
the financial liability, less any principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization of
the difference between the initial carrying amount and the maturity value, calculated using the
effective interest method, less any impairments (either directly or through the use of a provision
account) due to a decrease in value or non-recovcry.
The effective interest method is the method used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial
liability or group of financial liabilities and allocate interest income or expense over the relevant
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows that will
be paid or received throughout the expected life of the financial instrument, or shorter if necessary,

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is reflected at the value that the financial
instrument could be exchanged for in a current transaction between knowledgeable and willing
parties.
The company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate fair value:
• The fair value of cash, short-term bank deposits, accounts receivable from customers, payables
to suppliers, and other short-term payables is equivalent to the book value of these items due
to their short-term nature. -
• The fair value of receivables and loans with fixed or variable interest rates is assessed based on
information such as interest rates, risks, repayment ability, and the nature of the risk associated .­
with the debt. Based on this assessment, the company estimates provisions for the portion that _
may not be recoverable.
• The fair value of financial assets available for sale that are listed on the stock market is the
quoted trading price at the end of the fiscal year. The fair value of financial assets available for
sale that are not listed is estimated using appropriate valuation methods.
