differences between book values of assets and liabilities serving the preparation of the financial
statements and the values for tax purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all the
temporary taxable differences. Deferred income tax assets are recorded only when there is an
assurance on the availability of taxable income in the future against which the temporarily
deductible differences can be used.
Carrying values of deferred corporate income tax assets are considered as of the balance sheet date
and will be reduced to the rate that ensures enough taxable income against which the benefits from >N'
part of or all of the deferred income tax can be used. Deferred corporate income tax assets, which
have not been recorded before, are considered as of the balance sheet date and are recorded when
there is certainly enough taxable income to use these unrecognized deferred corporate income tax
assets.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are determined at the estimated rate =
to be applied in the year when the assets are recovered or the liabilities are settled based on the
effective tax rates as of the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is recognized in the income
statement. In the case that deferred income tax is related to the items of the owner’s equity,
corporate income tax will be included in the owner’s equity.
The Company shall offset deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if, and only if:
• The Company has the legal right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax
liabilities; and
• Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are relevant to corporate income
tax which is under the management of one tax authority either:
Of the same subject to corporate income tax; or
The Company has intention to pay current income tax liabilities and current income tax
assets on a net basis or recover tax assets and settle tax liability simultaneously in each
future period to the extent that the majority of deferred income tax liabilities or deferred
income tax assets are paid or recovered.
