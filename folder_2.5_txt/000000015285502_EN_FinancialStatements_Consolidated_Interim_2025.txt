REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS II
To: The Shareholders of Vietnam Thuong Tin Commercial Joint Stock Bank
We have reviewed the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements of Vietnam Thuong Tin
Commercial Joint Stock Bank (“the Bank”) and its subsidiary as prepared on 4 August 2025 and set out
on pages 6 to 79, which comprise the interim consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June
2025, the interim consolidated income statement and the interim consolidated statement of cash flows
for the six-month period then ended and the notes.
The Board of Management’s responsibility
The Board of Management of the Bank is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the
interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards,
Vietnamese Accounting System for Credit Institutions and the statutory requirements relevant to the
preparation and presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements, and for such internal control
as the Board of Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of the
interim consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
Auditors’ responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim consolidated financial statements based on
our review. We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review Engagements
No. 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity.
A review of interim consolidated financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards
on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of
all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

20.1 Current corporate income tax
The Bank has the obligation to pay corporate income tax ("CIT”) at the rate of 20% of taxable
profits for the current period (previous period: 20%).
The Bank’s tax reports are subject to examination by the taxation authorities. Since the
application of tax laws and regulations to many types of transactions is susceptible to varying
interpretations, amount reported in the interim consolidated financial statementss could be
changed at a later date upon final determination by the tax authorities.
Current corporate income tax payables are determined based on taxable income of the
current period. Taxable income differs from the one reported in the interim income statement
since taxable income excludes incomes which are taxable or expenses which are deducted
in prior years due to differences between the Bank’s accounting policies and the tax
regulations and excludes tax exempted income and non-deductible expenses. The current
corporate income tax payables of the Bank are calculated based on the statutory tax rates
applicable up to the year end.

33. OFF BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS
V
33.1 Foreign exchange commitments
Foreign exchange commitments present settlements which the Bank and its subsidiary will
perform according to agreed foreign exchange commitments.
A spot foreign exchange transaction is an exchange of an amount of a foreign currency for
VND or another foreign currency at the spot exchange rate and be settled within two working
days from the transaction date.
Currency swap is a transaction between two parties which involves buying and selling of an
amount of foreign currency and VND or another foreign currency on different days at different
exchange rates on each day determined at the transaction date.
Details of foreign exchange commitments of the Bank and its subsidiary at period-end are as

42,327,209 35,401,945
33.2 Trade finance commitments
In the normal course of business, the Bank and its subsidiary are parties to financial
instruments that are recorded off-statement of financial position. These financial instruments
mainly comprise foreign exchange commitments, guarantee commitments and commercial
letters of credit. These instruments involve elements of credit risk for the Bank and its
subsidiary, which are not reflected in the items recognized in the consolidated statement of
financial position.
Credit risk for off-balance sheet financial instruments is defined as the possibility of sustaining
a loss for the Bank and its subsidiary if any other party to a financial instrument fails to perform
in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued by the Bank and its subsidiary to
guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party including guarantee for borrowings,
settlement, and performing contracts and bidding. The credit risk involved in issuing
guarantees is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.
Commercial at sight letters of credit represent a financing transaction by the Bank and its
subsidiary to its customer where the customer is usually the buyer/importer of goods and the
beneficiary is typically the seller/exporter. Credit risk is limited as the merchandise shipped
serves as collaterals for the transaction.
Deferred payment letters of credits represent the amounts at risk should the contract be fully
affected but the client defaults in repayment to the beneficiary. Deferred payment letters of
credit that defaulted by clients are recognized by the Bank and its subsidiary as granting of a
compulsory loan with a corresponding liability representing the financial obligation of the Bank
and its subsidiary to pay the beneficiaries and to fulfill the guarantor obligation.

or counterparties fail or unable to discharge their contractual obligations.

as well as guidelines for the standardization of credit operations.
The Bank and its subdiary manage and control credit risk by setting limits on the amount of
risk it is willing to accept for individual counterparties and for geographical and industry
concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits. Counterparty’s limits
are established by the use of a credit rating system, which assigns each counterparty a risk
rating. Risk ratings are subject to regular revision with SBV.
The Bank and its subsidiary have established a credit quality review process that allows for
early prediction of changes in the financial position and repayment capacity of partners based
on qualitative and quantitative factors.

35.2 Market risk
(a) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect the fair
values of financial instruments. The Bank and its subsidiary are exposed to interest rate risk
as a result of mismatches of maturity dates or dates of interest rate re-pricing in respect of
assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments over a certain period.
The interest rates set by the Bank and its subsidiary for loans to customers and customer
deposits are respectively presented in Note 10 and Note 18.
Analysis of assets and liabilities based on interest rate re-pricing date
The real interest rate re-pricing term is the remaining period from the date of preparation of the
financial statements to the most recent interest re-pricing period or the maturity date of the items
on the consolidated statement of financial position whichever is earlier.
The following assumptions and conditions have been adopted in the analysis of interest rate 6!
re-pricing terms of the assets and liabilities of the Bank and its subsidiary:
► Cash, long-term investments, derivatives and other financial assets, other assets »(
(including fixed assets, receivables and other assets) and other payables are classified pv
as non-interest-bearing items. .t i
► Balances with the SBV are considered as current and the re-pricing term is therefore
considered within one (1) month. ^
► The re-pricing period of interest rate of investment securities are determined based on
the maturity date of securities at date of the interim consolidated financial statements.
► The re-pricing term of borrowings from Government and the SBV, due from and loans to
other credit institutions, loans to customers, receivables from sale of debts, due to and
borrowings from other credit institutions, due to customers and valuable papers issued is
determined as follows:
Items which bear fixed interest rate for the entire contractual term: The re-pricing term
is determined based on the remaining contractual term from the consolidated
statement of financial position date.
Items which bear floating interest rate: The re-pricing term is determined based on
the nearest interest re-pricing date from the interim consolidated statement of
financial position date.

deposits from various sources in addition to its basic capital resources. In addition, the Bank
and its subsidiary have established policy for control of liquidity assets flexibly; monitor the
future cash flows and daily liquidity. The Bank and its subsidiary have also evaluated the
estimated cash flows and the availability of current collateral assets in case of obtaining more
deposits. N
Liquidity risk exposure is managed by maintaining not limited to cash and cash equivalent by
Nostro account, balance with SBV and other credit institutions and other valuable papers. •£'
Safety ratios related to risk are used to manage liquidity risk. ‘^(
The maturity term of assets and liabilities is the remaining period of assets and liabilities as
calculated from the consolidated statement of financial position date to the settlement date in
accordance with contractual terms and conditions.
The following assumptions and conditions are applied in the maturity analysis of the assets
and liabilities of the Bank and its subsidiary:
► Balances with the SBV are classified as demand deposits which include compulsory
deposits;
► The maturity term of held for trading securities and investment securities is determined
based on the maturity date of each kind of securities;
► The maturity term of borrowings to Government and the SBV, due from and loans to other
credit institutions and loans to customers is determined on the maturity date as stipulated
in contracts. The actual maturity term may be altered because loan contracts may be
extended;
► The maturity term of long-term investments is considered as more than five years
because these investments do not have specific maturity date;
► Vostro account and demand deposits are transacted as required by customers, and
therefore, being classified as current accounts. The maturity term of due to and
borrowings from other credit institutions, derivative and other financial assets, customer
deposits, valuable papers issued and other payable are determined based on features of
these items or the maturity date as stipulated in contracts. The maturity term of borrowings
and term deposits is determined based on the maturity date in contracts. In fact, these
amounts may be rotated, and therefore, they last beyond the original maturity date;
The maturity term of fixed assets and other assets is determined on the remaining useful life
of assets.
