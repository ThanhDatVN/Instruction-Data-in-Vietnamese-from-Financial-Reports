the value of the land. Within 7 days from the date of signing the agreement, REFICO will deposit VND 50 billion to ensure
the implementation of the agreement. Except for force majeure cases, if REFICO does not comply with the agreements, it
will lose all the amount paid to VNSTEEL - Thu Duc Steel Joint Stock Company. Similarly, if VNSTEEL - Thu Duc Steel
Joint Stock Company does not comply with the agreement, it will have to refund the full amount received, and compensate
an amount equal to the received amount.
On 09 July 2019, REFICO sent Official Dispatch No. 04/2019/CV-REFICO confirming that the two sides would suspend
cooperation because the Decision No. 86/2010/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister terminated. REFICO also confirmed that
VNSTEEL - Thu Duc Steel Joint Stock Company had to return the deposit amount without paying the deposit penalty or
interest. Corresponding to the non-refundable deposit, REFICO gave the priority to co-invest in and develop real estate
projects on the existing land.

equitization finalization of the Corporation. In cases beyond competence, the Ministry of Finance has the responsibility to
report to the Prime Minister for decision.

2. For the land area in the North Urban Area, Nguyen Du ward, Ha Tinh city, the value of land use rights shall be calculated

responsibilities to report to the Prime Minister for consideration according to the provisions of Clause 4, Article 21 of
