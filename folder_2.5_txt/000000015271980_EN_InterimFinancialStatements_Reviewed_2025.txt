Explanation content:
In the semi-annual Financial statements for 2025. the Company recorded a profit after tax
of VND 0.23 billion, a significant improvement compared to the loss of VND 6.854 billion in
the same period of 2024. This positive change mainly comes from strong revenue growth and
effective cost control.
Specifically, net revenue this period reached VND 10.057 billion, an increase of 326.69%
(equivalent to VND 7.7 billion) compared to the same period in 2024. This increase was
mainly due to the sharp increase in the number of students during the period. Costs of goods
sold increased slightly, reflecting improved operating efficiency.
Notably, the Business management costs this period decreased to VND 1,201 billion,
compared to VND 1.509 billion in the same period last year. This shows that control
management costs has brought about clear results in optimizing costs while maintaining
revenue growth.
The above is the main reason for the increase in after-tax profit in the first semi- annual
of 2025 compared to the same period last year.

REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT WORK
Regarding the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
The first six months of the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2025
Dear : Shareholders, the Board of Directors, and the Management Board
Van Lang Technology1 Development and Investment Joint Stock Company
We have reviewed the accompanying Interim Financial Statements of Van Lang Technology
Development and Investment Joint Stock Company, prepared as of Joly 30, 2025. covering pages 07 to
42. including; the Interim Balance Sheet as at June 30, 2025. the Interim Statement of Profit or Loss
and Other Comprehensive Income, the Interim Statement of Cash Flows for the six-month period ended
December 31,2025. and the Notes to the Interim Financial Statements.
Management's Responsibility
Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the Interim F inancial
Statements in accordance with the applicable Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting
Regime, and relevant legal regulations related to the preparation and presentation of financial statements. (
Management is also responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal controls that jq
management determines necessary to ensure the preparation and presentation of interim financial statements
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Interim Financial Statements based on our review.
We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review Engagements No. 2410-
Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. 1
I
F
A review of interim financial information consists primarily of applying analytical procedures and
making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing, and consequently
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might
be identified in an audit. Therefore, we do not express an audit opinion.

4. Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that a party to a contract is unable to fulfill its obligations, causing financial loss
to the Company,
I
The Company faces credit risks from its business activities (mainly from accounts receivable) and z
financial activities (bank deposits, loans, and other financial instruments).
Accounts Receivable tl^il
I The Company mitigates credit risk by only transacting with financially capable entities, requiring¡1^I
letters of credit from first-time or financially unverified clients, and having accounting staff regularly \ * \
monitor receivables to ensure timely collection. Given that the Company’s receivables are spread
I across many different customers, credit risk is not concentrated on any single customer.
Bank Deposits
Most of the Company's bank deposits are held at large, reputable banks in Vietnam. The Company
I considers the credit risk concentration for bank deposits to be low.
5. Liquidity Risk
I Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company encounters difficulty in meeting its financial obligations
due to a lack of cash.
The Management holds the highest responsibility for managing liquidity risk, the Company’s
liquidity risk mainly arises from the mismatched maturities between financial assets and financial
liabilities.
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining an adequate amount ofcash and cash equivalents
and borrowing al levels deemed sufficient by Management to meet the Company's operating needs,
thus minimizing the impact ofcash flow fluctuations.

• The fair value of cash, short-term bank deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other short­
term payables approximates their carrying amount due to their short-term nature.
• The fair value of receivables and loans with fixed or variable interest rates is assessed based on
information such as interest rates, risks, repayment capacity, anti related credit risks. Based on this
assessment, the Company estimates provisions for potentially uncollectible amounts.
• The fair value of listed financial assets available for sale is the quoted market price at the end of ?
the financial year. The fair value of unlisted financial assets available for sale is estimated using
appropriate valuation methods, /
7, Market Risk /
