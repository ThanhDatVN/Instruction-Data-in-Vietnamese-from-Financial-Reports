The selection of figures and information presented in the notes to the financial statements is complied with the
material principle in Vietnamese Accounting Standard No.21 - Presentation of the financial statements.
IV. APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1. Basis of consolidation ^
The consolidated financial statements comprise of the financial statements of ILA Joint Stock Company and its
subsidiaries' ("the Group of the Companies") for the period ending March 31,2024
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are consolidated from the purchase date when the Group starts control to
the date it ceases the control.
The subsidiaries' financial statements are prepared for the same accounting period as the Company under the
accounting policies in consistency with the company's. The adjustments for any different accounting policies are
implemented to ensure the consistency between the subsidiaries and the Company.
All inter-company balances and revenue, income, expenses incurred from transactions of the Group including
unrealized gains incurred from inter-company transactions in the assets' value are completely eliminated.
Unrealized loss incurred from intra-group transactions recorded in the assets' value are eliminated when the expenses
resulting in the loss are unrecoverable.
Interest of uncontrolled shareholders represents the portion in gain or loss and net assets of the subsidiaries that are
not held by the Group and presented separately in the consolidated Income Statement and from shareholders' equity
of the Group in the owners' equity in the consolidated Balance Sheet.
Losses incurred in the subsidiary are allocated in correspondence with the uncontrolled shareholders' portion of
ownership, including the case where those losses are greater than the uncontrolled shareholders' portion of ownership
in the subsidiary's net asset.
Goodwill (or bargain purchase gain) arising from the acquisition of a Subsidiary is the difference between the cost of
the investment and the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the Subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is
amortized over its estimated useful life, which should not exceed 10 years. The Group periodically reassesses the
impairment of goodwill. If there is evidence that the amount of goodwill lost is greater than the annual allocation, the
goodwill is amortized in the period in which it arises.

For the accounting period ending March 31, 2025 Unit: VND
2. Principles for recording cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash and demand deposit
Cash equivalents comprise term deposits and other short-term investments with an original maturity of three months
or less, highly liquid, readily convertible to known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in
value.
3. Principles for accounting financial investments
Held-to-inaturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments include term deposits and held-to-maturity loans for the purpose of periodic interest
receiving and other held-to-maturity investments.
The held-to-maturity investments are initially recorded at the original cost including buying price and costs
attributable to the acquisition of the investments. After initial recognition, if the provision for doubtful debts has not
been made as statutorily required, these investments are revaluated at the recoverable value. When firm evidence
shows that a portion or the whole investments may be unrecoverable, the loss will be recorded in financial expenses
in the year and recorded in decrease of the investment's value.
Receivables from loans
Loans are loans based on contracts, agreements, and loan agreements between two parties with the purpose of
collecting interest periodically and are recorded at original cost minus provisions for doubtful debts. Provision fof
doubtful debts of loans is established based on the estimated amount of lost value that is overdue, not overdue blit
may not be collected due to the borrower's inability to pay. /
4. Principles for recording trade receivables and other receivables
Receivables are stated at original cost less provision for doubtful debts.
The classifying of the receivables as trade receivables, inter-company receivables and other receivables depends on
the nature of the transaction or relationship between the company and debtor.
Method of making provision for doubtful debts: provision for doubtful debts is estimated for the loss value of the
receivables, other held-to-maturity investments similar to doubtful debts that are overdue and undue, but are likely to
become possibly irrecoverable due to insolvency of debtors who go bankruptcy, making procedures for dissolution,
gojnissing or run away....
5. Principles for recording inventories
Inventories are stated at original cost less (-) the provisions for the decline in value of inventories and obsolete,
deteriorated inventories.
Original costs are determined as follows:
- Raw materials, materials, goods: include purchase price, transportation costs and other directly related costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
- Work in process: include compensation costs, site clearance, site leveling, land use rights costs, main raw material
costs, direct labor costs and general production costs incurred during the implementation of projects and unfinished
basic construction works.

For the accounting period ending March 3 J, 2025 Unit: VND
5. Principles for recording inventories
Method of calculating inventories' value: Weighted average method.
Method of accounting for the inventories: Perpetual method.
Method of making provision for decline in value of inventories: Provision for decline in value of inventories is
made when the net realisable value of inventories is lower than their original cost. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Provision for decline in value of
inventories is the difference between the cost of inventories greater than their net realisable value. Provision for
decline in value of inventories is made for each inventory with the cost greater than the net realisable value.
6. Principles for recording fixed assets
6.1 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. The initial cost of a tangible fixed
asset comprises all expenditures of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. The
expenditures incurred after initial recognition are capitalised as an additional cost of tangible fixed assets when they
have resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of those tangible
fixed assets. The expenditures which do not meet the above conditions are charged to the expenses in the year. ý
When the assets are sold or disposed, their original costs and the accumulated depreciation which have been written
off and any gain or loss from disposal of assets are recorded in the income statement.
Tangible fixed assets purchased
The original cost of purchased tangible fixed assets shall consist of the actual purchase price (less (-) trade discounts
or reduction plus (+) taxes (excluding taxes to be refunded) and relevant expenses calculated to the time when such
fixed assets are put into operation such as fees for installation and trial operation of fixed assets; specialists and other
direct costs.
Fixed assets which are buildings, structures attached to land use rights, the value of land use rights is computed
separately and recorded as intangible fixed assets.
6.2 Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. The original cost of a intangible fixed-asset
comprises all costs of owning the asset to the date it is put into operation as expected.

6.3 Leased Fixed Assets
Leased fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of a leased fixed asset is the lower of
the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments
plus any initial direct costs incurred in connection with the lease. All leases other than finance leases are considered
operating leases.
6.4 Method of depreciating and amortizing fixed assets
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of fixed assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Useful life means the duration in which the tangible fixed assets produce their effect on production and business.
The estimated useful life for assets is as follows:
Buildings and structures 06 - 08 year
Machinery and equipment 06 - JO year
Transportation and facilities 03 - 08 year
X
Office equipment 05 year

expiration of the lease contract.
7. Principles for recording construction in progress
Construction in progress is stated at original cost. This includes the cost of software development and any costs
necessary to acquire new fixed assets.
These costs are capitalised as an additional cost of asset when the works have been completed. After the works have
been finalized, the asset will be handed over and put into use.
8. Principles for recording prepaid expenses
Prepaid expenses are all expenses that actually incurred but relate to the operating result of several accounting
periods. The Group's prepaid expenses include insurance costs awaiting allocation, costs for marketing and apartment
distribution services and consulting costs awaiting allocation.
The determining and allocating of prepaid expenses into costs of production and doing business of each period is on
a straight-line basis. Based on the nature and level of each expense, the term of allocation is defined as follows: short­
term prepaid expenses should be allocated within one year; long-term expenses should be allocated in the term from
over 12 months to 36 months. Particularly, the prepaid land lease is amortized to expenses on a straight-line basis
over the lease period.
9. Principles for recording liabilities
Liabilities are recorded at original cost and not lower than the payment obligation.
Liabilities shall be classified into trade payables, inter-company payables and other payables depending on the nature
of transactions and relationship between the Group and debtors.
At the reporting date, if it is evident that there is an unavoidable loss, an amount payable shall be recorded according
to prudent principle.
