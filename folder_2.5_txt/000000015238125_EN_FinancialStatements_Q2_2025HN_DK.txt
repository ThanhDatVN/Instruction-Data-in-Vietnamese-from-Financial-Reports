Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets
are capitalized as part of the asset's cost. These include interest expenses, amortization of discounts or premiums
on bond issuance and ancillary costs incurred during the borrowing process.
The capitalization of borrowing costs should be temporarily suspended in periods during which the investment
in construction or production of uncompleted assets is interrupted, except for cases where such interruption is
necessary.
The capitalization of borrowing should cease when substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare the
asset for its intended use or sale are complete. Borrowing costs arising afterward should be recognized as in­
period production or business costs.
Income generated from the temporary investment of specific bonowings, pending their utilization for the
acquisition of qualifying assets, must be deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.
The amount of borrowing costs capitalized during a period must not exceed the amount of borrowing costs
incurred during that period. Interest expenses and the amortization of discounts or premiums capitalized during a
period must not exceed the actual interest incurred and the amount of discounts or premiums amortized during
that period.

while long-term prepaid expenses are allocated over a period from 2 to 3 years.

- Actual expenses that have not yet been incurred but are deducted in advance from production and business
expenses in the period to ensure that when actual expenses arise, they do not cause sudden changes in
production and business expenses on the basis of ensuring the principle of matching between revenue and
exnenses.
When such costs arise, if there is a difference with the amount deducted, the accountant will record additional or
reduce the cost corresponding to the difference.
- For specific fixed assets whose repair is cyclical, the major repair costs for these assets are provided based on
estimates or plans and are recorded as production and business expenses.

36 Explanation of Quarter 2 in 2025 Business Results - Year-on-Year Change Exceeding 10%:
Profit after tax decreased by VND 90 billion (equivalent to a 97% decrease), mainly due to a reduction of approximately
VND 89 billion in other income. The main reason is that in Quarter 2 in 2024, the Company recorded income from interest
forgiveness of over VND 92 billion, related to overdue interest on loans for newbuilding vessel projects financed by The
Vietnam Development Bank

support its business operations. Therefore, the Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the prices of these
materials, goods, tools, and supplies. This risk is mitigated by sourcing from a diverse range of suppliers located in various
countries and regions, as well as maintaining flexibility in negotiating and adjusting sale prices to customers in response to
significant price fluctuations in the market.
Credit risk: Consist of liquidity risk and interest rate risk: The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that funds
are available to meet current and future liabilities. The Company's policy is to regularly monitor the liquidity requirements
for current and expected future liabilities to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet short-term and long-term
liquidity needs.
