REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
To: THE SHAREHOLDERS, THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF GENERAL \
DIRECTORS
KHANH HOA SANEST SOFT DRINK JOINT STOCK COMPANY V?
We have reviewed the accompanying Financial Statements of Khanh Hoa Sanest Soft Drink Joint Stock
Company (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”), which were prepared on 25 April 2025 from 5 to page
35 including the Balance Sheet as of 31 March 2025, the Income Statement, the Cash Flow Statement for the
first quarter of the fiscal year ending 31 December 2025 and the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Responsibility of the Board of General Directors
The Company’s Board of General Directors is responsible for the preparation, true and fair presentation of the
Financial Statements in accordance with the Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise
Accounting System and relevant statutory requirements on the preparation and presentation of the Financial
Statements; and responsible for the internal control as the Company’s Board of General Directors determines
necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements to be free from material
misstatement due to fraud or error.
Responsibility of Auditors
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Financial Statements based on our review. We conducted
our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Review Engagements 2410 - Review of Interim
Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Company, scope of these principles can be
applicable to review engagement of historical finance information perfonned by Independent Auditor of the
Company.
A review of financial information involves performing inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial
and accounting matters, and applying analytical procedures and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters
that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion of auditor
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
Financial Statements do not give a true and fair view of the financial positions in all material respect, financial
performance as of 31 March 2025, its business results and its cash flows for the first quarter of the fiscal year
ending 31 December 2025, in accordance with the Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese
Enterprise Accounting System and relevant statutory requirements on the preparation and presentation of the
Financial Statements.

part of or all of the deferred income tax can be used. Deferred corporate income tax assets, which

there is certainly enough taxable income to use these unrecognized deferred corporate income tax
assets.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are determined at the estimated rate
to be applied in the year when the assets are recovered or the liabilities are settled based on the
effective tax rates as of the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is recognized in the income
statement. In the case that deferred income tax is related to the items of the owner’s equity,
