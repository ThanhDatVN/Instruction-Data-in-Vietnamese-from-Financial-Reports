operating policies at these companies.
Book value of investment in associate: using the cost method. The carrying amount of an investment in
a subsidiary is determined at its original cost, and is not adjusted thereafter for changes in the investor's
share of the investee's net assets. Cost includes purchase price and costs directly attributable to the
investment. In case of investment in non-monetary assets, the cost of the investment is recorded at the
fair value of the non-monetary assets at the time of occurrence.
Provision for loss of investment in joint ventures and associates is made when the enterprise receiving
the invested capital suffers a loss leading to the possibility of loss of capital or when the value of
investments in joint ventures and associates decreases in value. The basis for setting up provisions for
investment losses is the financial statements of the invested company. The maximum loss provision is
recorded at the investment capital contribution.

EXPLANATION
PROFIT AFTER TAX FOR Q2 2025 INCREASED COMPARED TO Q2 2024
To: State Securities Commission of Vietnam
Hanoi Stock Exchange
The company recorded a post-tax profit of VND 1,327,323,227 in Q2/2025, a decrease of 29.39% (equivalent
to a drop of VND 552,512,619) compared to the same period in 2024 (Q2/2024 post-tax profit was VND
1,879,83 5,846). The reasons for this decline are as follows:
Regarding Revenue and Gross Profit:
Net revenue from sales of goods and services in Q2/2025 decreased by VND 469,069,454, equivalent to a 1.77%
drop compared to Q2/2024.
Product categories with increased revenue included office supplies, cultural products, and various printed
materials. Meanwhile, revenue decreased for categories such as textbooks, children's books, various types of
stories, and office rental services.
Retail revenue from bookstores slightly increased compared to the same period last year.
Wholesale revenue from textbooks decreased.
As a result of the above factors, gross profit in Q2/2025 decreased by VND 48,397,817 compared to Q2/2024,
equivalent to a 0.90% decline.
Total selling expenses and general & administrative expenses in Q2/2025 increased by VND 572,508,759,
equivalent to an 18.22% rise compared to Q2/2024.
Most expense items remained relatively consistent with the same period last year, such as packaging materials,
tools and supplies, land lease and land use taxes, electricity, water, depreciation, outsourced services, loading
and unloading, etc.
The expense items that increased include salary provisions and transportation costs.
Financial Income and Other Income:
Financial income and other income in Q2/2025 decreased by VND 84,775,684, equivalent to a 3 8.05% drop
compared to the same period, mainly due to a reduction in term deposits, leading to a decrease in interest income.
The above is the Company’s explanation for the decrease in post-tax profit in Q2/2025 compared to Q2/2024.
Respectfully submitted.
