- Sales revenue increased by 98.39% over the same period last year, due to the continuously
boost in implementation of public investment disbursement (according to data released by the
Ministry of Finance, disbursement of public investment capital by the end of June 2025 was VND
268,133.9 billion, an increase of 42.3% over the same period in 2024), logistics projects and large
infrastructure projects nationwide, leading to the increase in demand of freight carriers as well as
project contractors for vehicle investment.
- Financial expenses decreased by 9.94% over the same period last year thanks to:
+ During the period, the Company has still maintained the policy of actively paying off high-
interest-rate debts before due date, resulting in efficient control over borrowing costs;
+ Flexible and efficient exchange rate management through purchase of foreign currency
futures (forward) for payables in USD, thereby leading to gain on exchange rate
differences.
+ Change in payment method: shiftting most payments from LC UPAS to deferred LC with
lower incured fees.
Vietnam Machine Investment Development Joint Stock Company would like to explain
