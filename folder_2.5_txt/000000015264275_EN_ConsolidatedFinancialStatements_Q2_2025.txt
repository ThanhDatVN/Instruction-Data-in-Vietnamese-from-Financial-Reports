Current income tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except when it relates
to items recognized directly to equity, in which case the current income tax is also dealt with in equity.

to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the Group intends to settle its
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date
between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purpose.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
+ Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction which at the time of the related transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable
profit or loss; and
+ In respect of taxable temporarily differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and
associates, and interests in joint ventures where timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can
be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax
credit and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against
which deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax credit and unused tax losses can be
utilised, except:
+ Where the deferred tax asset in respect of deductible temporary difference which arises from the
initial recognition of an asset or liability which at the time of the related transaction, affects neither the
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
+ In respect of deductible temporarily differences associated with investments in subsidiaries,
associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is
probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of
deferred tax asset to be utilised. Previously unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each
balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable
profit will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items
recognised directly to equity, in which case it is also dealt with in the equity account.

5. Company Risk Management
The Company's main financial liabilities include borrowings, payables to suppliers, and other payables. The primary purpose of these financial liabilities
is to raise capital for the Company's operations. The Company has financial assets such as receivables from customers and other receivables, cash and
cash equivalents, investments in listed and unlisted securities arising directly from the Company's operations.
The key risks arising from the Company's financial instruments are market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
Risk management is an integral part of the Company’s entire business operations. The Company has established a control system to ensure an
appropriate balance between the cost of risk and the cost of risk management. The Board of Directors continuously monitors the Company’s risk
management process to ensure an appropriate balance between risk and risk control.
The Company's Managent has reviewed and agreed to apply the following risk management policies:
5.1. Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk
includes three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk, and price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings,
corporate bonds, convertible bonds, deposits, and financial investments
The sensitivity analyses presented below are prepared based on the net debt values, with the ratio between fixed-rate debt and floating-rate debt
remaining unchanged
a. Currency Risk
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The ,
Company's foreign exchange risk is mainly related to its operations (when revenue or expenses are denominated in a currency other than the functional w
currency). ^
Currency Sensitivity
As the company was established and operates in Vietnam with the reporting currency being Vietnamese Dong, the main transaction currency of the ^
Company is also Vietnamese Dong. Therefore, the Company's foreign exchange risk is insignificant At the end of the reporting period, the Company had d
an insignificant balance in foreign currencies, so the Company did not perform a sensitivity analysis for foreign currency.
b. Interest Rate
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Company’s interest rate risk relates primarily to cash, short-term deposits, and borrowings.
The Company manages interest rate risk by analyzing market conditions to obtain the most favorable interest rates while remaining within its risk
management limits.
The Company did not perform a sensitivity analysis for interest rates because the risk from changes in interest rates at the reporting date
c. Price Risk
Equity Price Risk:
Listed and unlisted equities held by the Company are affected by market risks arising from the uncertainty of the future value of the investment shares,
leading to potential increases/decreases in the value of the investment impairment provision. The Company manages equity price risk by setting
investment limits. The Company's Board of Directors also reviews and approves equity investment decisions.
The Company will analyze and present the sensitivity of the impact of share price fluctuations on the Company's business results when detailed guidance
is provided by regulatory agencies.
Real Estate Price Risk:
The Company has identified the following risks related to its real estate investment portfolio:
-Project development costs may increase if there are delays in the planning process. To mitigate this risk, the Company hires expert consultants
specializing in specific planning requirements within the project scope to reduce potential risks arising during the planning process.
- Fair value risk of the real estate portfolio due to market fundamentals and buyers.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
5.2. Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument or transaction will fail to meet its obligations, resulting in a financial loss. The Company has
credit risk from its business operations primarily relating to customer receivables and from financing activities including bank deposits, foreign
exchange, and other financial instruments.
a. Customer receivables
The Company mitigates credit risk by only dealing with financially sound entities, and the accounts receivable staff regularly monitors receivables to
expedite collection. On this basis, the Company's receivables relate to a large number of different customers, so credit risk is not concentrated on one
customer
b. Bank deposits
The Company primarily maintains deposit balances with well-known banks in Vietnam. Credit risk relating to deposit balances with banks is managed by
the Company's treasury department in accordance with Company policy. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk with respect to bank
deposits to be low.
5.3. Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations due to a shortage of funds. The Company's liquidity
risk primarily arises from the mismatched maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities
The Management has ultimate responsibility for managing liquidity risk. A large portion of the Company's payment obligations are secured by deposits
and short-term receivables and assets. The Company considers the concentration of liquidity risk with respect to meeting financial obligations to be low
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining a level of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings at a level that the Board of Directors deems
sufficient to meet the Company's operational needs to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in cash flows.
The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities based oncontractual undiscounted expected payment terms:

The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is reflected at the value at which the financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction
between knowledgeable, willing parties.
The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate fair value: the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is not revalued
at the year-end. However, the Board of Directors believes that there is no material difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of its
financial assets and financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.
