REVIEW REPORT ON INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
To: Shareholders, Board of Directors and Board of Management
Thai Trung Rooting Joint Stock Company
We have reviewed the Interim Financial statements of Thai Trung Rooling Joint Stock Company prepared on
05 August 2025, from page 06 to page 35 including: Interim Statement of Financial position as at 30 June
2025, Interim Statement of Income, Interim Statement of Cash flows and Notes To Interim Financial
Statements for the period from 01 January 2025 to 30 June 2025.
The Board of Management’ responsibility
The Board of Management is responsible for the preparation of Interim Financial Statements that give a true
and fair view in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, Vietnamese Corporate Accounting
System and the statutory requirements relevant to the preparation and presentation of Interim Fnancial
Statements and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
Interim Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
i
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these Interim Financial Statements based on our review. We ^h
conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review Engagements 2410, Review of Ai
Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. q
A review of Interim Financial Information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters
that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Auditor’s Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
Interim Financial statements does not give a true and fair view, in al material respects, of the financial
position of Thai Trung Rooling Joint Stock Company as at 30 June 2025, and of its financial performance and
its cash flows for the six-month period then ended in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards,
Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and the statutory requirements relevant to the preparation and
presentation of Interim Financial statements.

4Emphasis of matter
As at 30 June 2025, the Company's short-term liabilities (code 310) exceeded its short-term assets (code 100)
by VND 339.67 billion and liabilities were 2.72 times higher than owner's equity, accumulated loss (code
421) by VND 201.1 billion, equivalent to 39.59% of the owner's equity (code 411). This situation, together
with the matters stated in Note 01, indicates the existence of a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt
on the Company's ability to continue as going concern. The Interim Financial statements for the period from 1
January 2025 to 30 June 2025 are still presented on the basis of the assumption of going concern.
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.

NOTES TO INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the periodfr ' om 01/01/2025 to 30/06/2025
1 . GENERAL INFORMATION
Form of ownership
Thai Trung Rooling Joint Stock Company was established and operates under Business Registration
Certificate No. 4600451322, initially issued by the Department of Planning and Investment of Thai Nguyen
province on 29 August 2008 and most recently amended for the 8th time on 24 August 2021.
The Company’s head office is located at: Gia Sang Ward, Thai Nguyen Province, Vietnam.
The Company’s registered charter capital is VND 508,000,001,467, with the actual contributed charter
capital as of 30 June 2025 being VND 508,000,001,467; equivalent to 50,800,000 shares at a par value of
VND 10,000 per share.
As at 30 June 2025, the Company had a total of 248 employees (as at 01 January 2025: 249 employees).
Business field
Industrial production.
Business activities
Main business activities of the Company include manufacture of iron and steel.
The Company’s operation in the accounting period that affects the Interim Financial Statements
As at 30 June 2025, the Company recorded an accumulated loss of VND 201.1 billion. At the same time, its jt'
total liabilities were 2.72 times higher than owner's equity and short-term liabilities exceeded current assets 111
by VND 339.67 billion. These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast :A
significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern depends on its future profitability and/or its ability to obtain financial
support from other parties.
The Company currently has a key customer purchasing large quantities of goods, Thai Nguyen Iron and
Steel Joint Stock Corporation. This is also the main supplier of raw materials with favorable payment terms
to reduce the Company's working capital pressure. The support in both of input supply and output
consumption has made the Company's production and business results profitable in recent years, with
accumulated losses reduced from VND 202.74 billion as at 1 January■ 2025 to VND 201.1 billion as at 30
June 2025. Additionally, the Company receives an annual credit limit from the Joint Stock Commercial
Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam, ensuring adequate working capital for its operations.
On this basis, the Board of Management believes that the preparation of the Interim Financial Statements for
the accounting period from 1 January 2025 to 30 June 2025 under the going concern assumption is
appropriate.

November 2020 issued by the Ministry of Finance is carried forward to the next taxable period for the
determination of total loan interest cost deductible if total loan interest cost deductible in the next taxable
period is lower than the amount prescribed. The loan interest costs may be carried forward for a maximum
consecutive period of 05 years, counting from the year following the year in which non-deductible loan
interest costs arise. The actual loan interest costs carried forward to subsequent years for tax purposes will
depend on the examination and approval of the tax authorities and may differ from the amounts presented in
