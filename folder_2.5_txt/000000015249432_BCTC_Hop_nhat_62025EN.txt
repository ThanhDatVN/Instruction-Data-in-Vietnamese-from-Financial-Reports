All the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the accrual basis (except for the information
related to cash flows).
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in Vietnamese and English, in which the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Vietnamese are the official statutory financial statements of the Group. The
Consolidated Financial Statements in English have been translated from the Vietnamese version. Should
there be any conflict between the Vietnamese and English versions, the Vietnamese version shall take
precedence.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Combined Financial Statements of the Parent Company
and the Financial Statements of its subsidiary. A subsidiary is a business that is controlled by the Parent
Company. The control exists when the Parent Company has the power to directly or indirectly govern the
financial and operating policies of the subsidiary to obtain economic benefits from its activities. In
determining the control power, the potential voting right arising from share call options, debt or equity
instruments that are convertible into ordinary shares as of the end of the fiscal year shall be taken into
consideration.
The Financial Statements of the Parent Company and its subsidiary used for consolidation are prepared for
the same accounting period and apply consistent accounting policies for similar transactions and events in
similar circumstances. In case the subsidiary’s accounting policies are different from those that are applied
consistently within the Group, the appropriate adjustments should be made to the subsidiary’s Financial
Statements before they are used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Intra-group balances in the balance sheet and intra-group transactions and unrealized intra-group gains or
losses resulting from these transactions are eliminated when preparing the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Unrealized losses resulting from intra-group transactions are also eliminated unless costs that
cause those losses cannot be recovered.
Non-controlling interests (“NCI”) include the gains or losses of the subsidiary’s business performance results
and net assets that are not held by the Group and are presented in a specific item in the Consolidated Income
Statement and the Consolidated Balance Sheet (as a part of the owner’s equity). NCI include the value of NCI
at the date of initial business combination and those in the changes of owner’s equity commencing from that
date. Losses arising in the subsidiary are allocated to NCI based on the non-controlling shareholders’ ownership
rate in the subsidiary, even if those losses excess the non-controlling shareholders’ ownership in the net assets
of the subsidiary.
