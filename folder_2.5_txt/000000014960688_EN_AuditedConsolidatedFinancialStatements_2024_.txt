INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To: The shareholders, the Board of Directors and Management
INDOCHINE IMPORT EXPORT INVESTMENT INDUSTRIAL JOINT STOCK COMPANY
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Indochine Import Export Investment
Industrial Joint Stock Company prepared on 14 May 2025, as set out on pages from 09 to 54, which comprises the
consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2024, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated cash flow
statement for the year then ended and the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Management' responsibility
The Board of Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
consolidated financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese
Accounting System for enterprises and statutory requirements relevant to preparation and presentation of the
consolidated financial statements, and for such internal control as the Board of Management determines is
necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors' responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with Vietnamese Audit Standards. Those standards require that we comply ^ith
ethical requirements and plan and perfonn the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidh^
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in,
consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, includin e
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's preparation
and fair in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the
s ( ĐÂI
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of
★ \ X
Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
qualified audit opinion.

During the year, pursuant to the Board of Directors’ Decision No. 0201/2024/QD-DDG dated 31/05/2024, the
Company temporarily suspended depreciation for certain factories and machinery and equipment related to projects
that had not generated or did not generate revenue in 2024, with a total value of VND 17,107,112,648. However, in
our opinion, this suspension of depreciation is not in compliance with the prevailing accounting regulations. If the
Company were to adjust the above matter in accordance with current regulations, it would result in an increase in
depreciation expense, thereby decreasing (or causing a loss in) the "Profits after corporate income tax" item on the
consolidated Income Statement (Code 60) and the "Undistributed earnings” item on the consolidated Balance Sheet
(code 421) by the corresponding amount of VND 17,107,112,648, and would impact the financial position and cash
flows presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Qualified opinion
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in "Basis for qualified opinion" paragraph, the
consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the consolidated financial
position of Indochine Import Export Investment Industrial Joint Stock Company as at 31 December 2024, and of
the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with H
Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Accounting System for enterprises and the statutory
requirements relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements. W
Emphasis of matter
We would like to draw attention to Note V.05 of the financial statements regarding "Other short-term receivables”.
As at 31/12/2024, the receivables from Mr. Nguyen Van Hop has a balance of VND 45,815,000,014 arising from
the Company’s transfer of shares in its subsidiary - CL Joint Stock Company. The total value of this transaction
was VND 80,800,000,000 resulting in an increase in the Company’s profits in 2024 of VND 55,550,000,000.
However, at the issuance date of this audit report, the Company has only collected VND 34,984,999,986 and the
remaining receivable of VND 45,815,000,014 has not yet been collected. Currently, the Company and Mr. Nguyen
Van Hop have entered into a pledge agreement securing the receivable with 2,590,000 shares of CL Joint Stock
Company.
Additionally, as presented in Note VIII.4 - Going Concern Information - as at 31/12/2024, the "Short-term
liabilities" item (code: 310) on the Balance Sheet exceeds the "Short-term assets" item (code: 100) by VND
202,676,177,445. At the same time, the Company’s "Short-term borrowings and finance lease liabilities" (code:
320) include overdue amounts totaling VND 539,344,867,555 that have not yet been settled. This situation reflects
a low current ratio and may affect the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. However, according to the
Company’s explanation, management is actively negotiating with credit institutions, as well as with organizations 010
and individuals holding the Company’s bonds, to arrange for extensions of overdue debts. In addition, the Company
ONG
has received commitments from certain major shareholders and creditors to support the Company in maintaining its 6 Ph
ic6n'
going concern status.

22. Principles and methods for preparing the consolidated financial statements
a. Accounting method for business combination transactions with subsidiaries
In the consolidated balance sheet, the carrying amount of the investment of the parent company in a subsidiary and
the parent company's ownership in the fair value of net assets of subsidiaries at date of acquisition must be eliminated
completely, the following principles:
- Parent Company shall recognize assets and liabilities of the subsidiary according to the fair value at the acquisition
date;
- The Parent Company must separately recognize the non-controlling shareholders’ interest in the difference between
the fair value and the book value of the subsidiary’s net assets at the acquisition date;
- The Parent Company recognizes deferred income tax liabilities for the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities whose fair
values exceed their book values; and recognizes deferred tax assets for the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities whose
fair values are lower than their book values.
Goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase arising from the acquisition of a subsidiary (if any) is recogniz^L’ ¿^
simultaneously with the elimination of the Parent Company's investment in the subsidiary.
H v
b. Method recognized interests of non-controlling shareholders i(NH k£i
vkiemto
In the consolidated balance sheet, non-controlling interests in the fair value of the net assets of subsidiaries ara^
identified and presented as a separate line item under equity.
Losses incurred by a subsidiary must be allocated to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their ownership,
even if such losses exceed the non-controlling interests' share in the subsidiary’s net assets.
In the consolidated income statement, non-controlling interests are determined and presented separately under the
item “Profit after tax attributable to non-controlling interests.’’ Non-controlling interests are calculated based on the ^
non-controlling shareholders’ ownership percentage and the post-tax profit of the subsidiaries. The income
attributable to non-controlling shareholders in the operating results of subsidiaries is reflected under the item “Profit
r n
after tax attributable to non-controlling interests - Code 62.” ;^(
iHAf
In addition to the above, non-controlling shareholders' benefit also affected by other internal transactions. q qj
c. Accounting methods of recognizing profit and loss when there is a change ownership percentage at y^p^
subsidiaries
If, after gaining control of a subsidiary, the parent company continues to invest in the subsidiary to increase its
ownership interest, the difference between the cost of the additional investment and the book value of the acquired net
assets must be recorded directly in retained earnings and treated as equity transactions (not recognized as goodwill or
gain from a bargain purchase). In this case, the parent company does not remeasure the subsidiary’s net assets at fair
value as of the date of obtaining control.
In a business combination achieved in stages, prior to eliminating the parent company’s investment in the subsidiary,
certain adjustments must be made to the cost of the parent’s investment in the consolidated financial statements.

financial statements.

payables, unrealized revenue, upfront costs ... must be completely excluded when preparing consolidated financially

activities and financial costs arise from the revaluation of cash items denominated in foreign currencies, revenue for
rent, service providers... within the consortium should be eliminated completely.
e. Goodwill

cost subtracting accumulated amortization. Original cost of goodwill is the difference between the cost of purchase
and the Group's interest in the net fair value of the buyer's assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. The negative ^
spread (negative goodwill) is recognized in the consolidated business results. Nr

Reason for non-payment: The overall economic difficulties have severely impacted the Company's business operations. Additionally, banks have tightened their credit appraisal and
lending policies. As a result, when banks stop extending or issuing new credit limits for borrowing businesses, the Company’s working capital experiences a significant shortfall,
leading to low payment cash flow. These factors have caused the Company to struggle with meeting its due debt obligations to the bank.
