REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
To: The Board of Directors and the Board of Management
Quang Binh Water Supply Joint Stock Company
We have reviewed the accompanying interim financial statements of Quang Binh Water Supply Joint Stock
Company (the “Company”), prepared on 1 August 2025, from page 5 to page 27 which comprise the interim
balance sheet as at 30 June 2025, the interim statement of income, the interim statement of cash flows for
the 6-month period then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information.
Chairman of The Board of Directors and the Board of Management's Responsibility for the interim
financial statements
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Board of Management of Quang Binh Water Supply Joint
Stock Company are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these interim financial statements
in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, accounting regime for enterprises and legal
regulations relating to interim financial reporting and for such internal control as management determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
S.M
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the accompanying interim separate/consolidated financial A*
statements based on our review. We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on
Review Engagements (VSRE) 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity.
A review of interim separate/consolidated financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of
person responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on
Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
interim financial statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as at 30 June 2025, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the 6-month period then
accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, accounting regime for enterprises and legal
elating to interim consolidated financial reporting.

accounting regime for enterprises and legal regulations relating to interim financial reporting requires
Board of Directors and Board of Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the interim financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.
Although these accounting estimates are based on the Board of General Directors’s best knowledge,
actual results may differ from those estimates.

NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
These notes are an integral part of and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying interm financial statement
IV. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Receivables
Receivables represent the amounts recoverable from customers or other debtors and are stated at
book value less provision for doubtful debts.
Provision for doubtful receivables is made for each receivable based on the overdue period of principal
repayment in accordance with the original debt agreement (excluding any extensions agreed upon
between parties) or based on the estimated potential loss as assessed by the Company. The
difference between the provision to be made at the end of the current fiscal year and the provision
already recorded at the end of the prior fiscal year is recognized as an increase or decrease in general
and administrative expenses during the fiscal year. Receivables determined to be uncollectible are
written off.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and
where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Inventory value is determined according to the
weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all
estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The evaluation of necessary provision for inventory obsolescence follows current prevailing accounting
regulations which allow provisions to be made for obsolete, damaged, or sub-standard inventories and
for those which have costs higher than net realisable values as at the balance sheet date.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of a fixed asset acquired through purchase includes the purchase price and all other costs
directly related to bringing the asset into a state of readiness for use. For fixed assets acquired through
capital construction investment under the method of contracting or self-construction and production,
the cost is the final settlement price of the construction project according to current investment and
construction management regulations, other directly related costs and registration fees (if any). In case
the project has been completed and put into use but the final settlement has not been approved, the
cost of the fixed asset is recorded at the provisional price based on the actual costs incurred to acquire
the fixed asset. The provisional price will be adjusted according to the settlement price approved by
competent authorities.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life,
specifically as follows:
Years
Buildings and structures 05 - 50
Machinery, equipment 06-20
Vehicles, transportation equipment 05 - 30
Pipeline transport equipment 15-30
Office equipment and furniture 05 - 08
Tangible fixed assets are revalued when there is a decision of the State or when a State-owned
enterprise is equitized. The original price and accumulated depreciation are adjusted according to the
revaluation results approved by competent authorities as prescribed.
The profits and losses arising from the liquidation and sale of assets are the difference between the
income from liquidation and the remaining value of the assets and are recorded in the Business
PerformanceReport.

IV. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Intangible assets and amortisation
The Company's intangible fixed assets are accounting software.
Intangible fixed assets are recorded at original cost, reflected in the Balance Sheet according to the
indicators of original cost, accumulated depreciation and residual value. Costs related to computer
software programs that are not part of the related hardware are capitalized.
The original cost of computer software is all costs that the Company has spent up to the time the
software is put into use. Computer software is amortized on a straight-line basis from 05 to 08 years
Construction in progress
Assets under construction for production, rental, management or other purposes are recorded at
historical cost. These costs include costs necessary to form the asset, including construction,
equipment, other costs and related interest costs in accordance with the Company's accounting policy.
These costs will be transferred to the original cost of fixed assets at the provisional price (if there is no
approved final settlement) when the assets are handed over for use.
According to the State's regulations on investment and construction management, depending on the
management level, the settlement value of completed basic construction works must be approved by
//
competent authorities. Therefore, the final value of basic construction works may change and depends
c
on the settlement approved by competent authorities. •Q
Prepayments
1
Prepaid expenses include actual expenses that have been incurred but are related to the results of
production and business activities of many accounting periods. Prepaid expenses include the value of
tools, instruments, small components issued for use, other repair costs and are considered to have the
potential to bring future economic benefits to the Company. These costs are capitalized in the form of
prepayments and allocated to the Income Statement, using the straight-line method in accordance with
current accounting regulations.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all five (5) following conditions are satisfied:
(a) The Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the
goods;
(b) The Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;
(c) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; When the contract stipulates that the buyer is
entitled to return the products or goods, purchased under specific conditions, revenue is
recognized only when those specific conditions no longer exist and the buyer is not entitled to pay
return products and goods (except for cases where customers have the right to return goods in
the form of exchange for other goods or services);
(d) The Company has obtained or will receive economic benefits from the sale transaction; and
(e) The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue of a transaction involving the rendering of services is recognised when the outcome of such
transactions can be measured reliably. Where a transaction involving the rendering of services is
attributable to several periods, revenue is recognised in each period by reference to the percentage of
completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date of that period. The outcome of a transaction
can be measured reliably when all four (4) following conditions are satisfied:
(a) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; When the contract stipulates that the buyer is
entitled to return the products or goods, purchased under specific conditions, revenue is
recognized only when those specific conditions no longer exist and the buyer is not entitled to pay
return products and goods;

Revenue recognition (continued)
(b) It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company;
(c) The percentage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured
reliably; and
(d) The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured
reliably.
Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis, determined on the balance of the deposit account
and the interest rate applied.
Interest from investments is recognized when the Company has the right to receive the profit.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the year when incurred unless they are
capitalised in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standard “Borrowing costs”. Accordingly,
borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets,
which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or
sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for
their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific
borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the cost of those assets.
For specific borrowings for the purpose of construction of fixed assets and investment properties,
borrowing costs are capitalised even when the construction period is under 12 months.
For general loans that are used for construction investment purposes or production of unfinished
assets, the capitalized borrowing costs are determined according to the capitalization rate for the
average cumulative cost, rights arising for investment in capital construction or production of that
asset. The capitalization rate is calculated according to the weighted average interest rate of
outstanding loans during the year, except for separate loans serving the purpose of creating a specific
asset.
Tax
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before
tax as reported in the interim income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that
are taxable or deductible in other years (including loss carried forward, if any) and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is recognised on significant differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the interim financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable
profit and are accounted for using balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally
recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilized.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The determination of the tax currently payable is based on the current interpretation of tax regulations.
However, these regulations are subject to periodic variation and their ultimate determination depends
on the results of the tax authorities’ examinations.

Tax (continued)
Other taxes are paid in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in Vietnam.
Basic/diluted earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the after-tax profit or loss allocated to shareholders
owning the Company's common shares (after adjusting for appropriations for bonus and welfare funds)
by the amount weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the after-tax profit (or loss) allocated to
shareholders owning the Company's common shares (after adjusting for dividends on preferred shares
with convertible rights) exchange for the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the year and the weighted average number of common shares that would be issued in the event
that all potential common shares are issued. All declines are converted into common shares.
Related parties
Enterprises and individuals that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, control or are
controlled by, or under common control with, the Company, including holding companies, subsidiaries
and fellow subsidiaries are related parties of the Company. Associates and individuals owning, directly
or indirectly, an interest in the voting power of the Company that gives them significant influence over
the enterprises, key management personnel, including directors and officers of the Company and close
members of the family of these individuals and companies associated with these individuals also
constitute related parties.
In considering each possible related party relationship, attention is directed to the substance of the
relationship, and not merely the legal form.

38,884,957,563) (Details in note V.14 - Borrowings and financial leasing liabilities).
The original cost of tangible fixed assets under the category of transportation and transmission increased during the period due to the temporary capitalization of the
projects 'Water Distribution Network System (MC3) HTCN in Ba Don town, Hoan Lao town, Phong Nha, and Quy Dat in 2023' and 'Raw Water Pipeline of Quy Dat
Water Treatment Plant.' These amounts, respectively recorded at VND 7,231,465,345 and VND 744,371,518, are based on actual incurred costs and acceptance
and handover documentation for operational deployment, serving as the basis for depreciation once the projects are brought into use. The historical cost of these
projects will be adjusted upon approval of the final settlement by the competent authority to reflect any arising differences (if any).

16. DEPARTMENT REPORT
According to the provisions of Vietnamese Accounting Standard No. 28 and its guiding circular, the
Company is required to prepare segment reporting. A segment is a separately identifiable component
of the Company that engages in providing related products or services (business segment), or provides
products or services within a specific economic environment (geographical segment), each of which is
subject to risks and earns economic benefits that differ from those of other segments.
The Board of Management has assessed that the Company operates primarily in a single business
segment, which is the production and sale of domestic water (as detailed in Note VI.1, revenue from
water supply accounts for 89.9% of total revenue), and the principal geographical segment is within
Quang Tri Province. Therefore, the Company does not prepare segment reporting in accordance with
this standard.

Re:_Explanation of the difference in profit after tax
for the 6-month accounting period ended June 30,
2025,compared to the same period in 2024
To: State Securities Commission
Hanoi Stock Exchange
Based on Circular No. 96/2020/TT-BTC dated November 16, 2020, issued by the
Ministry of Finance on guidance for information disclosure in the securities market.
Based on the financial statements audited by the International Auditing Company
Limited for the 6-month accounting period ended June 30, 2025, of Quang Binh Water
Supply Joint Stock Company, submitted to the State Securities Commission and the Hanoi
Stock Exchange.
Quang Binh Water Supply Joint Stock Company explains the difference in after-tax
profit in the financial statements for the 6-month accounting period ending June 30, 2025,
compared to the same period in 2024 as follows:
- Revenue from tap water supply did not increase due to the impact of weather,
other revenues decreased due to the liquidation of labor contracts operating with Biwase
Quang Binh Joint Stock Company.
- Cost of capital increased by 8,48% over the same period in 2024, equivalent to an
increase of VND 4.041 billion; The reason for the increase was that Biwase Quang Binh
Joint Stock Company reduced the rate of support for the loss of water purchased through
the total meter from 15% to 9%; In the quarter, many pipelines broke down, so the cost of
remediation, flushing, electricity, and disinfectant chemicals in tap water production
increased.
- Selling costs have increased due to the increase in the number of customers
installing new meters in rural areas, causing the cost of installing new meters and
connection points to increase while the revenue from using tap water has not increased
accordingly.
Other indicators fluctuated according to the company’s actual production and
business operations but were not significant.
The aforementioned reason primarily accounts for the decrease in profit after
corporate income tax reported in the financial statements for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024 of Quang Binh Water Supply Joint
Stock Company.
