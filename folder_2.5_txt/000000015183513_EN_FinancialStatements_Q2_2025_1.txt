Accordingly, at the time of preparing the annual financial statements, if the value of investments in economic
entities has declined compared to the carrying value of the company's investment, the company will make
provisions for impairment as prescribed in Circular No. 48/2019/TT-BTC dated August 8, 2019, which
provides guidelines for the establishment and treatment of provision accounts.
5. Principles for recording receivables
Receivables are accounted for in detail for each receivable, each debt and each payment. Accountants
monitor each receivable and regularly check and urge debt collection and debt allocation. Receivables are
recorded at net value (according to the actual expected amount to be collected from those receivables), so the
Company must perform debt aging analysis to calculate the expected loss on late payment, bad debt that may
not be collected in the future to set up a provision according to the regulations of the Ministry of Finance to
reflect the net value of receivables.
6. Principles for recording inventories
Principles of inventory valuation: Inventories are determined on the basis of the lower of the original cost
and the net realizable value. The original cost of inventories includes the purchase price, purchase costs,
processing costs and other directly related cost's incurred to bring the inventories to their current location
and condition.
Method of calculating inventory value: Weighted average
Method of accounting for inventories: Perpetual Inventory.
- Allowances for decline in value of inventories: recorded when the net realizable value is less than the
original cost of inventories, the net realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventories minus the
estimated costs to complete the product and the estimated costs necessary to consume them.
7. Principles of recording depreciation of fixed assets, financial leased fixed assets, investment real
estate
3Principles of recording tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed assets: Fixed assets are presented at
original cost minus accumulated depreciation. The original cost of fixed assets includes the purchase
price and all other costs directly related to putting the asset into a state of readiness for use. For fixed
assets handed over from completed basic construction investment but not yet approved for final
settlement, the value recorded as an increase in the original cost of fixed assets is the handover value
based on the settlement between the two parties or the value of actual construction volume up to the time
of handover. When the final settlement of the project is approved, it will be adjusted according to the
settlement value.
Depreciation method of tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed assets: depreciated by the straight-line
method based on the estimated useful life, in accordance with Circular 45/2013/TT-BTC guiding the
management, use and depreciation of fixed assets, specifically as follows:_______________________

representing the amount the company has paid to rent 08 hectares of land paid in advance to Infrastructure

or more. These expenses are allocated to the Income Statement using the straight-line method over a
maximum period of three years, in accordance with current accounting regulations.
11. Principles of accounting for payables
Payables are tracked in detail by the amount of payable and the amount of payable paid by each
creditor. Payables are classified into short-term and long-term based on the payment period of each
payable. When preparing financial statements, accountants base on the remaining term of payables to
classify them as long-term or short-term. Provisions for payables (if any) are set up when there is
evidence that a loss is likely to occur and are immediately recorded as a payable according to the principle
of prudence.
12. Principles for recording Ioans and financial !«-•« liabilities

costs" - Vietnamese Accounting Standards. Borrowing costs are capitalized when the enterprise is certain
to gain economic benefits in the future from using that asset and the borrowing costs can be reliably
determined.
The time to start capitalizing borrowing costs into the value of unfinished assets is when all of the
following conditions are met: Costs for investment in construction or production of unfinished assets
begin to arise; Borrowing costs arise; Activities necessary to prepare the unfinished assets for use are in
progress. The capitalization of borrowing costs will end when the main activities necessary to prepare the
unfinished assets for use are completed. Borrowing costs incurred thereafter will be recorded as
production and business expenses in the period in which they arise.

distribution and allocation of funds from the company's profits.

revenue can be reliably measured.
Sales revenue is recognized when the risks, benefits and ownership of the goods are transferred to the
buyer, the Company no longer holds the right to manage the goods as the owner of the goods or the right
to control the goods; at the same time, the Company can determine the costs related to the sales

or not.
Revenue from rendering of services is recognized when the outcome of the transaction can be reliably
measured; It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the
company; The portion of work completed on the balance sheet date can be measured reliably; and the
costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.
For export goods and services revenue, it is the date of confirmation of completion of customs
procedures on the customs declaration.
Financial income from bank deposit interest is recorded based on the bank's monthly deposit interest
notice, deferred sales interest, payment discounts received for purchasing goods, services, etc. Dividends
and profits are distributed for the period after the date of investment in capital instruments of other
