4. KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES
4.1 . Basis for Preparing Financial Statements
The financial statements arc prepared on an accrual basis (except for information related to cash flows).
The accounting record format applied by the company is the General Journal.
4.2 . Foreign Currency Transactions
During the period, transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than VND are converted at the exchange rate on the
ry
transaction date. The balance of monetary items in foreign currencies at the end of the financial period is translated at the
exchange rate published by the Vietcombank — Ho Chi Minh City Branch on that date. IN
The exchange rate differences arising from transactions in foreign currencies during the period are recognized as financial income 8IÉ
or financial expenses. The exchange rate differences from revaluing monetary items in foreign currencies at the end of the
financial period, after offsetting the increase and decrease in differences, arc recognized as financial income or financial expenses. )N
The exchange rate used for converting foreign currency transactions is the actual transaction exchange rate at the time the f^
transaction occurs. The actual transaction exchange rate for foreign currency transactions is determined as follows:
• The exchange rate for buying and selling foreign currencies (spot contracts, forward contracts, futures contracts, options
contracts, swap contracts) is the rate agreed upon in the foreign currency purchase or sale contract between the company
and the bank.
• If the contract does not specify the payment exchange rate: • For capital contributions or receipt of capital: the buying
exchange rate of the foreign currency at the bank where the company opens the account to receive the capital from the
investor at the time of contribution. • For receivables: the buying exchange rate at the commercial bank designated by the
company for the customer to make payments at the time the transaction occurs. • For payables: the selling exchange rate
at the commercial bank where the company intends to transact at the time the transaction occurs.
• For transactions involving the purchase of assets or expenses paid immediately in foreign currencies (without using
accounts payable): the buying exchange rate of the commercial bank where the company makes the payment.
The exchange rate used to revalue the balances of monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at the end of the fiscal year is
determined based on the following principles:
• For foreign currency deposits in banks: the buying exchange rate of the foreign currency at the bank where the company
opens the foreign currency account.
• For monetary items denominated in foreign currencies classified as other assets: the buying exchange rate of the foreign
currency at Vietcombank - Ho Chi Minh City Branch.
• For monetary items denominated in foreign currencies classified as payables: the selling exchange rate of the foreign
currency at Vietcombank - Ho Chi Minh City Branch.
4.3 . Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand, demand deposits, and cash in transit. Cash equivalents arc short-term investments with a maturity of
three months or less from the acquisition date, which are easily convertible into a known amount of cash and subject to minimal
risk of changes in value.
4.4 . Financial Investments
Held-to-maturity Investments
An investment is classified as held-to-maturity when the Group has the intent and ability to hold it until maturity. Held-to-maturity
investments include term deposits (including treasury bills and promissory notes), bonds, preferred shares with a mandatory
buyback provision at a specified future date, and loans held to maturity with the objective of earning periodic interest, as well as
other held-to-maturity investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price and transaction costs related to acquiring
the investment. After initial recognition, these investments are measured at their recoverable amount. Interest income from held-to-
maturity investments after purchase is recognized in the income statement on an accrual basis. Any interest received prior to the
Group holding the investment is deducted from the purchase price at the time of acquisition.
If there is clear evidence that part or all of the investment may not be recoverable and the loss is reliably measurable, the loss is
recognized as a financial expense in the year and directly reduces the investment's carrying value.
Investments in Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures, and Associates
Subsidiary
A subsidiary is an enterprise that is controlled by the company. Control is achieved when the company has the ability to control
the financial and operating policies of the investee in order to obtain economic benefits from its activities.Joint Venture
A joint venture is an entity established based on an agreement between the Company and other parties, where the parties involved
undertake economic activities based on joint control. Joint control is understood as the shared decision-making process regarding
the strategic policies related to the operation and financial policies of the joint venture, which requires the agreement of all parties
involved.
Associate
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence but does not have control over its financial and operational
policies. Significant influence is evidenced by the right to participate in decisions related to the financial and operational policies of
the investee, but without control or joint control over these policies.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price or capital contribution and
any directly related costs of the investment. In the case of investments made with non-monetary assets, the investment is recorded
at the fair value of the non-monetary asset at the time of the transaction.
Dividends and profits from periods prior to the investment purchase are deducted from the carrying value of the investment.
Dividends and profits from periods after the purchase of the investment are recognized as revenue. Dividends received in the form
of shares are only tracked by the number of shares issued, without recognizing the value of the received shares.
A provision for loss on investments in joint ventures and associates is established when the joint venture or associate incurs losses. /fa/
The provision amount is determined by the difference between the actual capital contributions made by the parties in the joint ¡l:y
venture or associate and the actual equity of the entity, multiplied by the Group's ownership percentage compared to the total capital
contributions of all parties involved in the joint venture or associate. u^ \ \
The Parent Company’s investment in Sea Saigon Waterway Transport Joint Venture is valued at 1,224,000 USD, equivalent to 51%
of the charter capital. This investment is presented at cost due to the Sea Saigon Waterway Transport Joint Venture being in the
process of undergoing bankruptcy procedures. \
Investments in Equity Instruments of Other Entities
Investments in equity instruments of other entities include investments in equity instruments where the Group docs not have control,
joint control, or significant influence over the investee.
Investments in equity instruments of other entities are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price or capital contribution
and any direct costs related to the investment activity. Dividends and profits from periods prior to the investment purchase are
deducted from the carrying value of the investment. Dividends and profits from periods after the purchase of the investment are\ f^
recognized as revenue. Dividends received in the form of shares are only tracked by the number of shares issued, without recognizing \ f' ft
the value of the received shares. I
A provision for loss on investments in equity instruments of other entities is recognized as follows: / /^11
• For investments in listed shares or when the fair value of the investment can be reliably determined, the provision is /^7/
based on the market value of the shares.
• For investments where the fair value cannot be reliably determined at the reporting date, the provision is based on the
investee's losses, with the provision amount calculated as the difference between the actual capital contributions of the
parties in the other entity and the actual equity of the entity, multiplied by the Group's ownership percentage in relation to
the total capital contributions of all parties in the other entity.
The increase or decrease in the provision for loss on investments in equity instruments of other entities that needs to be recognized
at the end of the financial year is recorded as a financial expense.
4.5 . Receivables
Receivables are reported at their cost less provision for doubtful debts.
The classification of receivables into trade receivables and other receivables is made based on the following principles:

the Group and independent third parties, including receivables for sales of goods on consignment to other entities.
• Intercompany receivables reflect amounts due from subsidiaries that do not have legal status or separate accounting.
• Other receivables reflect amounts due that are non-commercial and unrelated to buying and selling transactions.

based on the balance of receivables at the reporting date. The provision for doubtful debts is cither recognized or reversed through
management expenses in the income statement.
4.6 . Inventory
Inventory is recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
The cost of inventory is determined as follows:
• Raw materials and goods: This includes the purchase cost and other directly related costs incurred to bring the inventory
to its current location and condition.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventory during normal production or business operations, less the estimated
costs to complete and the estimated necessary costs to sell the inventor)'.
Inventory is valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method and accounted for using the periodic inventory system.
Provision for Inventory Write-down
A provision for inventory write-down is made for each inventory item where the cost exceeds the net realizable value. For unfinished
seivices, the provision for write-down is calculated based on each type of service with a distinct price. The increase or decrease in
the provision for inventory write-down at the end of the financial year is recognized as part of the cost of goods sold.
4.7 . Prepaid Expenses
Tools and Equipment
Tools and equipment that have been put into use arc amortized over a period not exceeding 2 years using the straight-line method.Fixed Asset Repair Costs
Repair costs for fixed assets that do not meet the criteria for capitalizing as part of the asset’s cost are expensed. These costs are
amortized over a period not exceeding 3 years.
4.8 . Tangible Fixed Assets
Tangible fixed assets are recorded at their original cost, less accumulated depreciation. The original cost of tangible fixed assets
includes all costs incurred by the Group to acquire the asset and bring it to the condition necessary for use. Costs incurred after
initial recognition are added to the original cost of the asset only if these costs are expected to increase the economic benefits from
the use of the asset in the future. Costs that do not meet this condition arc recognized as expenses in the period in which they arc
incurred.
When selling or disposing of an asset, the original cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the financial statements,
and any resulting gains or losses are recognized in the income statement.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets, as
follows:
Buildings and structures 10-50 years
Machinery and equipment 3-15 years
Vehicles, transport and communication equipment 5-15 years 0
Managerial equipment 3-5 years
;(
4.9 . Intangible Fixed Assets
Intangible fixed assets arc recognized at their original cost, less accumulated amortization.
The original cost of intangible fixed assets includes all costs incurred by the Group to acquire the asset and bring it to a state where
it is ready for use. Costs related to intangible fixed assets incurred after initial recognition are expensed in the period unless these
i
costs are directly associated with a specific intangible asset and increase the economic benefits derived from the asset.
When an intangible asset is sold or disposed of, the original cost and accumulated amortization are removed from the financial
statements, and any resulting gains or losses from disposal arc recognized in income or expenses for the year.
Land Use Rights
Land use rights represent all the actual costs incurred by the Group related to land use, including the cost to acquire land use
rights, compensation for land clearance, ground leveling, and registration fees.
Land use rights with no term are not depreciated. For land use rights with a term, the depreciation period is the period during which
the Group is permitted to use the land. The Group's land use rights arc depreciated over 50 years.
Computer software
The purchase price of computer software that is not a part of the related hardware is capitalized. The original cost of computer
software is the total cost that the Group has incurred up to the time the software is put into use. Computer software is amortized on
a straight-line basis over 3-5 years.
4.10 Investment property
Investment property is the right to use land, buildings, part of buildings or infrastructure owned by the Group or finance leased for
the purpose of earning rental income or waiting for capital appreciation. Investment property is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. The cost of investment property is the total cost that the Group has to pay or the fair value of the consideration given
to acquire the investment properly up to the time of purchase or completion of construction.
Expenditures related to investment property incurred after initial recognition are recorded as expenses, unless these costs arc likely
to make the investment property generate economic benefits in the future in excess of the originally assessed level of performance,
then they are recorded as an increase in cost.
When investment property is sold, the cost and accumulated depreciation are written off and any gain or loss is recorded as income
or expenses in the period. Investment properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as
follows:
Land Use Rights 50 years
Houses, Structures 10-15 years
4.11 Construction in progress

accounting policies) to assets under construction, machinery and equipment being installed for production, leasing and management
purposes as well as costs related to repairs of fixed assets in progress. These assets are recorded at cost and are not depreciated.

fixed assets are handed over and put into a state of readiness for use.
4.12 Liabilities and accrued expenses
Liabilities and accrued expenses are recognized for amounts to be paid in the future related to goods and services received. Accrued
expenses arc recognized based on reasonable estimates of the amount to be paid.

Borrowing costs are recognized as expenses when incurred. In cases where borrowing costs are directly related to the investment in
construction or production of unfinished assets that take a long enough period (over 12 months) to be put to use for the intended
purpose or for sale, these borrowing costs are capitalized. For separate loans serving the construction of fixed assets, investment
real estate, borrowing interest is capitalized even if the construction period is less than 12 months. Income arising from temporary
investment of loans is recorded as a reduction in the original cost of related assets.
4.19 Corporate Income Tax
The corporate income tax expense includes current income tax and deferred income tax.
Current Income Tax
Current income tax is calculated based on taxable income. Taxable income differs from accounting profit due to adjustments for
temporary differences between tax and accounting, non-deductible expenses, as well as adjustments for income not subject to tax
and carryforward losses.
Deferred Income Tax
Deferred income tax is the income tax that will be payable or recoverable due to temporary differences between the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax base used to calculate taxable income. Deferred tax
liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are only recognized when it is probable that
taxable profits will be available in the future to utilize the temporary differences that will be deducted.
liD~iiThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each financial year and will be reduced to the amount that
ensures it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow the benefits of some or all of the deferred tax assets
to be utilized. Deferred tax assets that have not been previously recognized arc reviewed at the end of the financial year and
recognized when it is certain that sufficient taxable profits will be available to utilize the unrecognized deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arc determined based on the tax rate that is expected to apply in the year in which the asset will
be recovered or the liability will be settled, based on the tax rates enacted at the end of the financial year. Deferred income tax is
recognized in the income statement and is only directly recorded in equity when the tax is related to items recognized directly in
equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when:
• The company has a legal right to offset current income tax assets with current income tax liabilities; and
• The deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to the corporate income tax administered by the same tax
authority:
- For the same taxpayer; or
- The company intends to settle current income tax liabilities and current income tax assets on a net basis, or recover the
assets simultaneously with the settlement of liabilities in future periods when significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities
or deferred tax assets are settled or recovered.
The company's tax returns will be subject to examination by the tax authority. Due to the application of tax laws for each type of
transaction and the interpretation, understanding, and acceptance of these laws in various ways, the figures in the financial
2
statements may differ from those of the tax authority.
y
4.20 Basic Earnings Per Share
1

H
of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

4.22 Financial Instruments
Financial Assets
The classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial
recognition. The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, and other receivables.
At the time of initial recognition, financial assets are recorded at cost plus any transaction costs directly attributable to the financial
asset.
Financial Liabilities
The classification of financial liabilities depends on the nature and purpose of the financial liabilities and is determined at the time
of initial recognition. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade payables, accrued expenses, and other payables.
At the time of initial recognition, except for financial liabilities related to finance leases and convertible bonds which are recorded
at amortized cost, other financial liabilities are initially recorded at cost, less any transaction costs directly attributable to the financial
liability.
Amortized Cost
The amortized cost of a financial liability is determined by taking the initial carrying amount of the financial liability, subtracting
principal repayments, and adding or subtracting the cumulative amortization calculated using the effective interest method for the
difference between the initial carrying amount and the maturity value. It also subtracts any reductions (directly or through a provision
account) due to impairment or uncollectibility.
Effective Interest Method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability or a group of financial liabilities
and allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts
the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period if applicable,
to the net present carrying amount of the financial liability.
Equity Instruments
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Offsetting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis in the balance sheet only when and only if the Group:
- Ilas a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts; and
- Intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
8.1 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The main risks arising from financial instruments include market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
The Board of Directors reviews and applies management policies for the above risks as follows:
8.1.1 Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market
prices.
There are four types of market risk: interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk, and other price risks, such as equity
price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risks include deposit accounts.
T
Interest Rate Risk rộ
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market 41
interest rates.
fl
The Company's market risk from interest rate changes mainly relates to cash, short-term deposits, bonds, and loans (applied as
01
relevant in each case).
The Company manages interest rate risk by analyzing the competitive conditions in the market to obtain favorable interest rates
f<
for the Company’s purposes while remaining within its risk management limits.
Interest Rate Sensitivity
The Company does not conduct an interest rate sensitivity analysis because the risk from interest rate changes as of the financial
statement date is considered insignificant.
Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in
foreign exchange rates.
The Company faces foreign exchange risk arising directly from its business operations conducted in currencies other than the
Vietnamese Dong.
The Company manages foreign currency risk by reviewing current and forecasted market conditions when planning future
transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Foreign currency risk is managed by maintaining risk at an acceptable level, such as by signing contracts with domestic customers
for export supplies that include clauses on adjusting for exchange rate fluctuations when transactions with foreign customers
occur.
Foreign Currency Sensitivity
The Company does not conduct a foreign currency sensitivity analysis because the risk from foreign currency changes as of the
financial statement date is considered insignificant.
Equity Price Risk
Unlisted shares held by the Company are subject to market risk arising from uncertainties regarding the future value of the
investments.
The Company manages equity price risk by monitoring the business performance and financial condition of the investee
companies.
8.1.2 Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that a party to a financial instrument or transaction contract will fail to meet its obligations, resulting in a
financial loss.
The Company is exposed to credit risk arising from its business operations (mainly related to accounts receivable from customers)
and from its financial activities, including bank deposits.
Accounts Receivable from Customers
The Company regularly monitors outstanding receivables. For major customers, the Company assesses any deterioration in the
credit quality of each customer as of the repoiling date.
The Company strives to maintain tight control over outstanding receivables and assigns credit control personnel to minimize
credit risk.
Based on this approach and the fact that the Company's receivables are spread across a variety of customers, the Company is not
significantly exposed to credit risk concentrated in any single customer.
Bank Deposits
The Company mainly maintains deposit balances at well-known banks in Vietnam.
The credit risk associated with bank deposits is managed by the Company's treasury department in accordance with Company
policy.
The Company’s maximum credit risk exposure for items presented in the balance sheet as of the financial year-end date is the
carrying value disclosed in Note 5.1.
The Company assesses that the concentration of credit risk for bank deposits is low.8.1.3 Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due to a shortage of funds.
The Company's liquidity risk primarily arises from the mismatch of maturity dates between its financial assets and financial
liabilities.
The Company minimizes liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and bank loan facilities at levels that
management considers adequate to fund its operations and mitigate the effects of cash flow fluctuations.
The following table summarizes the maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted cash
flows:
