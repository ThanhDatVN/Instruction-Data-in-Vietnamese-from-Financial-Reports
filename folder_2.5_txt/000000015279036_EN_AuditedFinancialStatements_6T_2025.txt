REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
To: Shareholders, the Board of Directors and Board of Management
Cao Son Coal Joint Stock Company - TKV
We have reviewed the Interim Financial Statements of Cao Son Coal Joint Stock Company - TKV prepared
on 31 July 2025, as set out on pages 05 to 39, including: Interim Statement of Financial position as at 30
June 2025, Interim Statement of Income, Interim Statement of Cash flows and Notes to the Interim Financial
Statements for the period from 01/01/2025 to 30/06/2025.
Board of Management’s responsibility
The Board of Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of Interim Financial
Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, Vietnamese
Corporate Accounting System and the statutory requirements relevant to preparation and presentation of 12
Interim Financial Statements and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable
3 I
the preparation of Interim Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
-ÌH
fraud or error.
CM
Auditor’s responsibility 3
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these Interim Financial Statements based on our review. We 5
conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Review Engagements (VSRE) 2410 -
Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independend Auditor of the Entity.
A review of Interim Financial Statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing and
consequently does not enables us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters
that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Auditor’s conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
Interim Financial Statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, of the financial position of Cao
Son Coal Joint Stock Company - TKV as at 30 June 2025, and of the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the period from 01/01/2025 to 30/06/2025 in accordance with the Vietnamese Accounting
Standards, Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and the statutory requirements relevant to preparation
and presentation of Interim Financial Statements.
