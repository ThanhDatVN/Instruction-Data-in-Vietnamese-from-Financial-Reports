estimated costs of completion and estimated selling expenses.

sure to increase economic benefits in the future by using these assets. The costs incurred
are not satisfied conditions are recognized as an expense in the period.
When selling or liquidating assets, their cost and accumulated depreciation of the assets
are written off in the financial statements and any gain or loss which are arising from
disposal are recorded income or expense during the period.

monetary assets at the time of occurrence.

securities) and does not have significant influence over the investee, the provision is
made based on the loss recorded on the financial statements of the investee.
7. Principles of recognition and capitalization of borrowing costs:

related to the Company’s loans are recorded as production and business expenses in the

contributed in cash or in assets calculated according to the par value of shares issued

received compared to the par value when Second issuing or issuing additional shares and
the increase or decrease in the difference between the actual amount received compared
to the repurchase price when reissuing treasury shares. In case of buying back shares to
cancel immediately on the purchase date, the value of shares recorded as a decrease in
the business capital on the purchase date is the actual repurchase price and must also be
recorded as a decrease in the business capital in detail according to the par value and the
surplus capital of the bought back shares.
Principles for recording undistributed profits:
Principles for recording undistributed profits: are recorded as the profit (or loss) from
the business results of the Company after deducting (-) the corporate income tax expense
of the current period and adjustments due to retroactive application of changes in

current year according to the current corporate income tax law recorded.

balance sheet date between the tax base of assets, liabilities and their carrying value for
financial reporting purposes and the value used for tax purposes. Deferred income tax
6liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences, while deferred income tax assets
are only recognized when it is certain that there will be enough taxable profit in the
future to deduct the temporary differences.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets should be reviewed at the end of the reporting
period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit
will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilized.
Previously unrecognized deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of the reporting
period and recognized when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available
to utilize the unrecognized deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax is recognized in the income statement, except when it relates to an item
recognized directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognized directly in
equity.

a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities relating to corporate income taxes levied by the same tax authority
on the same taxable entity and the Company intends to settle current tax liabilities and
current tax assets on a net basis.

rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk, The Company’s
financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and liabilities, deposits,

will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates, Market risk for changes in interest
rates of the Company primarily relating to loans and liabilities, cash and short term deposits
of the Company,
Banks continue to maintain lending interest rates from 8-9%/year, stable financial expenses,
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of the future cash flows of a financial
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in exchange rates, The current foreign
exchange rate is stable, helping the Company feel secure in importing raw materials and
machinery and equipment,
Foreign currency sensitivity
15The Company does not perform a sensitivity analysis for foreign currencies because the risk
of changes in foreign currency exchange rates at the reporting date is insignificant,
Share price risk
The unlisted shares held by the Company are subject to insignificant market risks,

Credit risk is the risk that one party of a financial instrument or contract not performing its
obligations, resulting in financial losses, The Company has credit risk from its operating
activities (primarily for trade receivables account), and from its financial activities,
including bank deposits,

and the Company regularly monitors receivables closely to urge collection, On this basis and
the trade receivables of the Company related to many different customers, credit risk is not
significantly concentrated in a certain customer,
The Company’s Board of Directors assesses that all financial assets are within maturity and
not impaired because these financial assets are related to reputable and solvent customers,
11.3 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulties in implementing their
financial obligations due to lack of funds, Liquidity risk of the Company mainly arising
from financial assets and financial liabilities with maturity mismatches,
The Company monitors the liquidity risk by maintaining an amount of cash and cash
equivalents and bank loans at a level that Board of Directors supposes it is sufficient to meet
the Company’s operations and minimize the risks due to the volatility of cash flows,
