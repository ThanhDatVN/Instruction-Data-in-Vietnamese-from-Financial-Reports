the basis of accounting set out in Note 2 to the interim consolidated financial statements. The

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1 Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and
applicable regulations on preparation and presentation of consolidated financial
statements. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention except for business combinations as presented in Note 2.5.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are not intended to present the
consolidated financial position and results of consolidated operations and consolidated
cash flows in accordance with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in
countries and jurisdictions other than Vietnam’s. The accounting principles and practices
utilised in Vietnam may differ from those generally accepted in countries and jurisdictions
other than Vietnam.
The consolidated financial statements in the Vietnamese language are the official
statutory consolidated financial statements of the Company. The consolidated financial
statements in the English language have been translated from the Vietnamese version.
2.2 Fiscal year
The Company’s fiscal year is from 1 January to 31 December.
2.3 Currency
The consolidated financial statements are measured and presented in Vietnamese Dong
(“VND” or “Dong”), which is the Company’s accounting currency.
2.4 Exchange rate
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates prevailing at
the transaction dates. Foreign exchange differences arising from these transactions are
recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the consolidated
balance sheet date are respectively translated at the buying and selling exchange rates
at the consolidated balance sheet date of the bank with which the Company regularly
transacts. Foreign currencies deposited in bank at the consolidated balance sheet date
are translated at the buying exchange rate of the bank where the Company opens its
foreign currency accounts. Foreign exchange differences arising from these translations
are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

2.5 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has the power to govern the financial
and operating policies in order to gain future benefits from their activities generally
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence
and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are
considered when assessing whether the Company controls another entity. Subsidiaries
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They
are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Company has the power to govern the financial
and operating policies in order to gain future benefits from their activities generally
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence
and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are
considered when assessing whether the Company controls another entity. Subsidiaries
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They
are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries
by the Company. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets
given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of
exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non­
controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the
Company’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the
cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired,
the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
In a multi-phase acquisition, when determining goodwill or bargain purchase, the
consideration is the sum of the total consideration on the date of acquiring control and
previous considerations remeasured to fair value on the date of control acquisition.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions
between Company companies are eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Company.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same accounting period
of the Company for the consolidation purpose. If there are differences in end dates, the
gap must not exceed 3 months. Adjustments are made to reflect impacts of significant
transactions and events occurring between the end dates of the subsidiaries’ accounting
period and that of the Company’s. The length of the reporting period and differences in
reporting date must be consistent between years.

Form B 09a - DN/HN
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.5 Basis of consolidation (continued)
Non-controlling transactions and interests
The Company applies a policy for transactions with non-controlling interests as
transactions with external parties to the Company.
Non-controlling interests (“NCI”) are measured at their proportionate share of the
acquiree’s identifiable net assets at date of acquisition.
A divestment of the Company’s interest in a subsidiary that does not result in a loss of
control is accounted foras a transaction with owners. The difference between the change
in the Company’s share of net assets of the subsidiary and any consideration paid or
received from divestment of the Company’s interest in the subsidiary is recorded directly
in the undistributed earnings under equity.
In a divestment of the Company’s interest in a subsidiary that results in a loss of control,
the difference between the Company’s share in the net assets of the subsidiary and the
net proceeds from divestment is recognised in the consolidated income statement. The
retained interest in the entity will be accounted for as either an investment in another
entity or an investment to be accounted for as equity since the divestment date.
Associates
Associates are investments that the Company has significant influence but not control
over and the Company would generally have from 20% to less than 50% of the voting
rights of the investee. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The Company’s investment in
associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment
loss.
The Company’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of its associates is
recognised in the consolidated income statement. The cumulative post-acquisition
movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the
Company’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate,
the Company does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or
made payments on behalf of the associate.
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Company.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Company and its associates
are eliminated to the extent of the Company’s interest in the associates.

Form B 09a - DN/HN
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.6 Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the
Company’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary or associate at
the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is recognised as an asset
and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated period of benefit but not
exceeding a period of 10 years.
Goodwill on acquisitions of investments in joint ventures and associates is included in the
carrying amount of the investments at the date of acquisition. The Company does not
amortise this goodwill.
On disposal of the investments in subsidiaries or joint ventures and associates, the
attributable amount of unamortised goodwill is included in the determination of the profit
or loss on the disposal.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and is tested annually for
impairment. If there is evidence that the impairment during the year is higher than the
annual goodwill charge, the Company records the impairment immediately in the
accounting period.
2.7 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in banks, cash in transit, demand deposits and
other short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
2.8 Lendings
Lendings are lendings granted for the earning interest under agreements among parties
but not for being traded as securities.
Lendings are initially recognised at cost. Subsequently, the Board of Management
reviews all outstanding amounts to determine the amount of provision to recognise at the
year end. Provision for doubtful lendings is made for each lending based on overdue days
in payment of principals according to the initial payment commitment (exclusive of the
payment rescheduling between parties) or based on the estimated loss that may arise.
Changes in the provision balance during the fiscal year are recorded as an increase or
decrease in financial expenses. A reversal, if any, is made only to the extent the
investment is restored to its original cost.
Lendings are classified into short-term and long-term lendings on the consolidated
balance sheet.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.9 Receivables
Receivables represent trade receivables from customers arising from sales of goods and
rendering of services or non-trade receivables from others and are stated at cost.
Provision for doubtful debts is made for each outstanding amount based on overdue days
in payment according to the initial payment commitment (exclusive of the payment
rescheduling between parties), or based on the estimated loss that may arise. Bad debts
are written off when identified as uncollectible.
Receivables are classified into long-term and short-term receivables on the consolidated
balance sheet based on the remaining period from the consolidated balance sheet date
to the maturity date.
2.10 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by
the weighted average method and includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and
other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. In
the case of manufactured products, cost includes all direct expenditure and production
overheads based on normal levels of operating activity. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less the estimated costs of
completion and selling expenses.
The Company applies the perpetual system for inventories.
Provision is made, when necessary, for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory
items. The difference between the provision of this year and the provision of the previous
year are recognised as an increase or decrease of cost of goods sold in the year.
2.11 Investments
(a) Trading securities
Trading securities are other financial instruments, which are held for trading to earn
profits.
Trading securities are initially recorded at historical cost including cost of acquisition and
any expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition. Subsequently, the Board of
Management reviews all outstanding investments to determine the amount of provision
to recognise at the year end. The provision for diminution in value of trading securities is
made when their carrying value is higher than their market value. Changes in the provision
balance during the fiscal year are recorded as an increase or decrease in financial
expenses. A reversal, if any, is made only to the extent the investment is restored to its
original cost.

Form B 09a - DN/HN
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.11 Investments (continued)
(a) Trading securities (continued)
The Company recognises trading securities when it has ownership of the assets,
specifically as follows:
• Listed securities are recognised at the time of order matching; and
• Unlisted securities are recognised at the time when official ownership is
established in accordance with regulations.
Profit or loss from liquidation or disposal of trading securities is recognised in the
consolidated income statement. The costs of trading securities disposed of are
determined by using the moving weighted average method.
(b) Investments held to maturity
Investments held to maturity are investments which the Company has a positive intention
and ability to hold until maturity.
Investments held to maturity include term deposits at banks. Those investments are initially
accounted for at cost. Subsequently, the Board of Management reviews all outstanding
investments to determine the amount of provision to recognise at the year end.
Provision for diminution in value of investments held to maturity is made when there is
evidence that the investment is uncollectible in whole or in part. Changes in the provision
balance during the fiscal year are recorded as an increase or decrease in financial
expenses. A reversal, if any, is made only to the extent the investment is restored to its
original cost.
Investments held to maturity are classified into short-term and long-term investments held
to maturity on the consolidated balance sheet based on the remaining period from the
consolidated balance sheet date to the maturity date.
(c) Investments in associates
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method when preparing the
consolidated financial statements (Note 2.5).

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.11 Investments (continued)
(d) Investments in other entities
Investments in other entities are investments in equity instruments of other entities without
controlling rights or co-controlling rights, or without significant influence over the investee.
These investments are accounted for initially at cost. Subsequently, the Board of
Management reviews all outstanding investments to determine the amount of provision to
recognise at the year end.
Provision for investments in other entities is made when there is a diminution in value of
the investments at the year end. It is calculated based on market value if market value
can be determined reliably. If market value cannot be determined reliably, the provision
for investments in other entities is calculated based on the loss of investees.
Changes in the provision balance during the fiscal year are recorded as an increase or
decrease in financial expenses. A reversal, if any, is made only to the extent the
investment is restored to its original cost.
2.12 Business cooperation contract
A business cooperation contract (“BCC”) is a contract between the Company and other
parties to carry out specific business activities without establishing a new legal entity.
These activities are controlled by one of the parties under the BCC. The BCC is based
on shares of pre-tax profits. The parties in a BCC may agree to share profits before tax.
A BCC in the form of shares of pre-tax profits is controlled by one party, in which:
(i) If a BCC states that each party is entitled to a fixed amount of profit regardless of
the performance of the BCC, it is a lease of asset in substance.
(ii) If the BCC states that each party is entitled to profits when the BCC is profitable
and is required to bear losses when the BCC is loss making, in substance, the
BCC parties share revenue and expenses because each party can jointly control
the operation and cash flows of the BCC.
(iii) When the Company is in charge of accounting and tax finalisation, the Company
is required to recognise the entire revenue and expenses arising from the BCC,
and then allocate the proportionate shares of revenue and expenses to the other
parties in the year.
(iv) When the Company is not in charge of accounting and tax finalisation, the
Company accounts for its proportionate share of revenue and expenses from the
BCC.

Form B 09a - DN/HN
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.13 Fixed assets
Tangible and intangible fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortisation.
Historical cost includes any expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of
the fixed assets bringing them to suitable conditions for their intended use. Expenditure
which is incurred subsequently and has resulted in an increase in the future economic
benefits expected to be obtained from the use of fixed assets, can be capitalised as an
additional historical cost. Otherwise, such expenditure is charged to the consolidated
income statement when incurred in the year.
Depreciation and amortisation
Fixed assets are depreciated and amortised using the straight-line basis so as to write off
the depreciable amount of the fixed assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciable
amount equals to the historical cost of fixed assets recorded in the consolidated financial
statements minus (-) the estimated disposal value of such assets. The estimated useful
lives of each asset class are as follows:
Buildings and structures 5 - 20 years
Machineries and equipment 3 - 20 years
Office equipment 3-10 years
Motor vehicles and transmission 6-20 years
Investment licences 47 - 48 years
Others 2-10 years
Disposals
Gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing net disposal proceeds with
the carrying amount of the fixed assets and are recognised as income or expense in the
consolidated income statement.
Construction in progress
Construction in progress represents the cost of assets in the course of installation or
construction for production, rental or administrative purposes, or for purposes not yet
determined, which are recorded at cost and are comprised of such necessary costs to
construct, repair and maintain, upgrade, renew or equip the projects with technologies as
construction costs; costs of tools and equipment; compensation and resettlement costs;
project management expenditure; construction consulting expenditure; and capitalised
borrowing costs for qualifying assets in accordance with the Company’s accounting
policies. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other fixed assets,
commences when they are ready for their intended use.
2.14 Leased assets
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the lessor has transferred the ownership
at the end of the lease period, and transferred substantially the risks and rewards, are
classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease
at the lower of the fair value of leased assets or the present value of the minimum lease
payments.

Form B 09a - DN/HN
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.15 Prepaid expenses
-repaid expenses include short-term and long-term prepayments on the consolidated
balance sheet. Short-term prepaid expenses represent prepayments for services; or tools
that do not meet the recognition criteria for fixed assets for a period not exceeding 12
months or a business cycle from the date of prepayment. Long-term prepaid expenses
represent prepayments for services; or tools, which do not meet the recognition criteria
for fixed assets for a period exceeding 12 months or more than one business cycle from
the date of prepayment. Prepaid expenses are recorded at historical cost and allocated
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Prepayments for land rental contracts which are effective after the effective date of the
land law 2003 (ie. 1 July 2004) or which land use right certificates are not granted are
recorded as prepaid expenses and allocated using the straight-line method over the terms
of such land use right certificates.
2.16 Payables
Classifications of payables are based on their nature as follows:
• Trade accounts payable are trade payables arising from purchases of goods and
services; and
• Other payables are non-trade payables and payables not relating to purchases of
goods and services.
Payables are classified into short-term and long-term payables on the consolidated
balance sheet based on the remaining period from the consolidated balance sheet date
to the maturity date.
2.17 Borrowings and finance lease liabilities
Borrowings and finance lease liabilities include borrowings and finance leases from
banks, financial institutions, and other entities.
Borrowings and finance lease liabilities are classified into short-term and long-term
borrowings and finance lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet based on the
remaining period from the consolidated balance sheet date to the maturity date.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of any
qualifying assets are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and
prepare the asset for its intended use. In respect of general-purpose borrowings, a portion
of which is used for the purpose of construction or production of any qualifying assets, the
Company determines the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation by applying
a capitalisation rate to the weighted average expenditure on the assets. The capitalisation
rate is the weighted average of the interest rates applicable to the Company’s borrowings
that are outstanding during the year, other than borrowings made specifically for the
purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. Other borrowing costs are recognised in the
consolidated income statement when incurred.

2.18 Accrued expenses
Accrued expenses include liabilities for goods and services received in the year but not
yet paid for, due to pending invoices or insufficient records and documents. Accrued
expenses are recorded as expenses in the reporting year.
2.19 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive
obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be
required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provision is
not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the level of the expenditures expected to be required to settle
the obligation. If the time value of money is material, provision will be measured at the
present value using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due
to passage of time is recognised as a financial expense. Changes in the provision balance
during the fiscal year are recorded as an increase or decrease in operating expenses.
2.20 Capital
Owner’s capital is recorded according to the actual amounts contributed and is recorded
according to the par value of the shares.
Undistributed earnings record the Company’s ressult after CIT at the reporting date.
2.21 Appropriation of net profit
The Company’s dividends are recognised as a liability in consolidated financial
statements in the year in which the dividends are approved by the General Meeting of
Shareholders.
Net profit after CIT could be distributed to shareholders after approval at General Meeting
of Shareholders, and after appropriation to other funds in accordance with the Company’s
charter and Vietnamese regulations.

2.22 Revenue recognition
(a) Revenue from sales of goods
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised in the consolidated income statement when all
five (5) of the following conditions are satisfied:
• The Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of
ownership of the goods;
• The Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree
usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;
• The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to
the Company; and
• The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured
reliably.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of
the consideration due or the possible return of goods.
Revenue is recognised in accordance with the “substance over form” principle and
allocated to each sales obligation. If the Company gives promotional goods to customers
associated with their purchases, the Company allocates the total considerations received
between goods sold and promotional goods. The cost of promotional goods is recognised
as cost of goods sold in the consolidated income statement.
(b) Revenue from rendering of services
Revenue from rendering of services is recognised in the consolidated income statement
when the services are rendered, by reference to completion of the specific transaction
assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services
to be provided. Revenue from the rendering of services is only recognised when the four
(4) of the following conditions are satisfied:
• The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
• It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to
the Company;
• The percentage of completion of the transaction at the consolidated balance sheet
date can be measured reliably; and
• The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can
be measured reliably.
(c) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on the basis of the actual time and interest rates for each
period when both conditions are simultaneously satisfied:
• It is probable that economic benefits will be generated; and
• Income can be measured reliably.
(d) Dividends/profits income
Income from profits is recognised when the Company has established receiving rights
from investees.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.23 Cost of goods sold and services rendered
Cost of goods sold and services rendered are the cost of merchandise sold or services
rendered during the year and recorded on the basis of matching with revenue and on a
prudent basis.
2.24 Financial expenses
Financial expenses are expenses incurred in the year for financial activities including
expenses or losses relating to financial investment activities, interest expense from
borrowings and bonds, and other financial expenses.
2.25 Selling expenses
Selling expenses represent expenses that are incurred in the process of selling products,
goods, and providing services.
2.26 General and administration expenses
General and administration expenses represent expenses that are incurred for
administrative purposes.
2.27 Current and deferred income tax
Income tax includes all income tax which is based on taxable profits. Income tax expense
comprises current income tax expense and deferred income tax expense.
Current income tax is the amount of income tax payable or recoverable in respect of the
current year taxable profits at the current year tax rates. Current and deferred income tax
are recognised as an income or an expense and included in the profit or loss of the year,
except to the extent that the income tax arises from a transaction or event which is
recognised, in the same or a different year, directly in equity.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises
from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
combination that at the time of occurrence affects neither the accounting nor the taxable
profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined at the tax rates that are expected to
apply to the financial year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on
tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the consolidated balance
sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

2.28 Related parties
Enterprises and individuals that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries,
control, or are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company, including
holding companies, subsidiaries and fellow subsidiaries are related parties of the
Company. Associates and individuals owning, directly or indirectly, an interest in the
voting power of the Company that gives them significant influence over the Company, key
management personnel, including the Board of Directors, Board of Management of the
Company and close members of the family of these individuals and companies associated
with these individuals also constitute related parties.
In considering its relationships with each related party, the Company considers the
substance of the relationships not merely the legal form.
2.29 Segment reporting
A segment is a component which can be separated by the Company engaged in sales of
goods or rendering of services (“business segment”), or sales of goods or rendering of
services within a particular economic environment (“geographical segment”). Each
segment is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other segments. A
reportable segment is the Company’s business segment or the Company’s geographical
segment.
2.30 Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese
Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Accounting System and applicable regulations
on preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements requires the Board
of Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the financial year.
The areas involving significant estimates and assumptions are as follows:
• Electricity selling price (Note 5);
• Fair value of intangible fixed assets (Note 3).
Such estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated. They are based on historical
experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have a
financial impact on the Company and that are assessed by the Board of Management to
be reasonable under the circumstances.
