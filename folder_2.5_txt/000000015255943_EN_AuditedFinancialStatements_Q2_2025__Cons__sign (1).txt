Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets of a subsidiary, not held
by the Group’s shareholders and are presented separately in the consolidated income statements and
in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from the Parent company’s shareholders’ equity.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of a business
combination is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange plus any costs directly attributable to the business
combination. Identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business
combination are measured initially at fair values at the date of business combination.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of a business combination is less than the fair
value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the
consolidated income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any
accumulated amortization. Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of ten (10)
years.
4.2 Foreign currency transactions

ruling at the date of the transaction. At period-end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in

TN
recorded in financial income or financial expense. Exchange differences incurred due to revaluation
0 f
of accounts derived from foreign currencies at period-end are recorded net amount after offsetting
)U
gain and loss on exchange differences in financial income or financial expenses.
JI
The principles for determining real exchange rate upon re-determining accounts derived from foreign
currencies at the balance sheet date:
r.F
• For foreign currencies deposited in bank: buying exchange rate of the banks where the companies
in the Group open foreign currency accounts.
• For foreign currencies classified as other assets: buying exchange rate of the bank where the
companies in the Group regularly conduct transactions.
• For foreign currencies classified as liabilities: selling exchange rate of the bank where the
companies in the Group regularly conduct transactions.
The principles for determining the exchange rate when converting a subsidiary’s financial statements
prepared in a foreign currency into the Parent company’s accounting currency are determined as
follows:
• Assets, liabilities and goodwill arising on the acquisition of an overseas subsidiary are converted
into VND at the buying exchange rate of the bank at the balance sheet date.
• The subsidiary’s net asset value at the acquisition date held by the Parent company is converted
into VND at exchange rate in the accounting rate.
• Undistributed earnings after the acquisition date are converted into VND with reference to
respective items of the income statement.
• Dividends paid are converted into VND at the actual exchange rates available at the dates of
payment.
• Items of income statement and cash flow statement are converted into VND at the average
exchange rate of the reporting period.
