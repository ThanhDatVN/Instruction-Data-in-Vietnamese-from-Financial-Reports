fixed assets and investment properties.
6. Principles for recognizing inventories:
- Inventory recognition principle: Inventories are measured at cost. When the net realizable value is lower than cost, inventories are measured at net realizable value. The cost of inventories includes purchase costs,
processing costs, and Other directly attributable costs incurred to bring the inventories to their present location and condition.
- Inventory valuation method: The value of inventories is determined using the weighted average method.
- Inventory accounting method: Inventories are accounted for using the perpetual inventory system.

During use, finance-leased assets are recorded at original cost, accumulated depreciation, and net bode value.
- Depredation is calculated using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives are based on the depredation schedule specified in Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC dated 25 April, 2013, as follows:
+ Buildings and structures 05-50 years
+ Machinery and equipment 03-20 years

+ Other fixed assets 10 years
+ Land use ri^its 08-50 years
+ Management software and other intangible fixed assets 03-08 years

is charged over the lease term if shorter than its useful life.

value.

on tax rates and tax laws enacted at the end of the reporting period

than 12 months from the reporting date are classified as long-term. Those due within 12 months from the reporting date are classified as short-term to ensure proper repayment planning.
13. Principles for recognition and capitalization of borrowing costs:
- Borrowing costs are recognized as production and business expenses in the period incurred, except for borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets in

at year-end. This ensures that the actual recognition of such costs does not cause unexpected fluctuations in operating expenses and adheres to the matching principle between revenues and expenses. When the actual
expenses are incurred, any differences between the accrued amount and the actual cost are adjusted (either increasing or decreasing expenses accordingly). The Company’s main accrued expenses are interest payable
on loans.

reflects costs related to investment property activities such as: depreciation expense; repair expense; operating lease-related costs for investment properties (if not significant); disposal or liquidation costs of

of short-term securities, securities trading fees; provision for diminution in value of trading securities, provision for impairment of investments in other entities, foreign exchange losses, exchange rate differences, etc.
