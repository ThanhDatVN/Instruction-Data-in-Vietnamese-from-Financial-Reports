b. Financial Risk Management
The Company's operations expose it to the following financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and
market risk. The Director is responsible for establishing policies and controls to minimize financial
risks as well as monitoring the implementation of the policies and controls.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a party to a contract is unable to fulfill its obligations, resulting in financial
loss to the Company .
The Company's credit risks arise primarily from trade receivables and bank deposits.
Accounts receivable
The company minimizes credit risk by only dealing with financially sound entities, requiring letters
of credit or collateral for first-time entities or entities with no known financial capacity. In addition,
accounts receivable staff regularly monitor receivables to urge collection.
The Company's trade receivables are related to many entities and individuals, so the concentration
of credit risk for trade receivables is low.
Bank deposit
's term and non-term bank deposits are held at reputable banks, so the credit risk for bank deposits is
low.
The maximum credit risk exposure for financial assets is the carrying amount of the financial assets
(see note VII.5 on the carrying amount of financial assets).
The analysis table of the past due and impairment periods of financial assets is as follows:

and expected future payment requirements to maintain an appropriate amount of cash and loans,
monitoring actual and expected cash flows to minimize the impact of fluctuations in cash flows.
