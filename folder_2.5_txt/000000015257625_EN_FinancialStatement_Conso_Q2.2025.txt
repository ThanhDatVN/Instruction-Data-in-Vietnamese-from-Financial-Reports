NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies, which have been adopted by the Company in the preparation of these
consolidated financial statements, are as follows:
Estimates -^
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Vietnamese Accounting
Standards, accounting regime for enterprises and legal regulations relating to consolidated financial
reporting requires the Executive Board to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the accounting period.
Although these accounting estimates are based on the Executive Board’s best knowledge, actual results
may differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and enterprises
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) for the six-month period ended 30 June 2025. Control is
achieved when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of investee
enterprises to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated
income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting
policies used in line with those used by the Company.
Intra group transactions and balances are eliminated in full-on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those non-controlling interests at the date of the original
business consolidation (see below) and the non-controlling interests’ share of changes in equity since the
date of the consolidation. Losses in subsidiaries are respectively attributed to the non-conti olling interests
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Effects of changes in the ownership ratio of subsidiary without loss of control are recorded in Retained
earnings.
The non-controlling interest at the date of the business combination is determined initially based on the
ratio of non-controlling interest in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
recognised.
Business consolidations under common control
A business consolidation under common control is a business consolidation in which all firms are jointly
controlled by the same or more entities before and after a business consolidation, and this control is not
transient. A corporation may be controlled by an individual or group of individuals under a contractual
agreement.
A business consolidation transaction under common control is carried out as follows:
• Assets and liabilities of entities are consolidated at the carrying amount at the date of business
consolidation;
• There is no goodwill arising from a business consolidation transaction;
12SUNSHINE HOMES DEVELOPMENT JOINT STOCK COMPANY FORM B 09a-DN/HN
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
• A consolidated statement of business results that reflects the results of business activities of the
consolidated entities from the time of business consolidation;
• The difference between the cost of the business consolidation and the net asset value of the merged party
is recognized in equity. /|
Net assets are adjusted for unrealized profits (if any) at the date of business combination under common
control.
After the date of business combination, if the Company transfers and/or reduces the interest rate in the
investment in this entity, the difference between the cost of the combination and the net assets previously
recorded in Equity will be gradually allocated and recorded in the Retained earnings on the consolidated
Balance Sheet. yj
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary
nor an interest in joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and
operating policy decisions of the investee but not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial
statements using the equity method of accounting. Interests in associates are carried in the consolidated
balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Company’s share of the net assets of
the associate. Losses of an associate in excess of the Company's interest in that associate (which includes
any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Company's net investment in the associate) are
not recognised, unless the Company has an obligation to make payments on behalf of the associate for
debts that the Company has guaranteed and committed to pay. If the associate subsequently makes a profit,
the Company shall only recognise its share of that profit after it has offset the previously unrecognised net
loss.
Where a group entity transacts with an associate of the Company, unrealised profits and losses are
eliminated to the extent of the Company’s interest in the relevant associate.
Cash
Cash include cash on hand, bank demand deposits.
Financial investments
Hehl-to-maturity in vestments
Held-to-maturity investments comprise investments that the Company has the positive intent or ability to
hold to maturity, including bank term deposits. Held-to-maturity investments include bank deposits with
original maturities of more than 03 months.
Loan receivables
Loan receivables are measured at cost less provision for doubtful debts. Provision for doubtful debts
relating to loan receivables is made in accordance with prevailing accounting regulations.

bond par value.
Bond issuance expenses are amortized over time with the bond term on a straight-line basis. At the time of

Periodically, bond issuance costs are amortized by recording an increase in the value of the principal and
recording it into financial expenses or capitalization in accordance with the recognition of interest payable
on bonds.
Payable provisions
Payable provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of a past event,
and it is probable that the Company will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at
the Executive Board’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation as at the
consolidated balance sheet date.

accounting periods for services on apartment management and operation fees that have been yet provided
or delivered. The Company recognizes unearned revenue in proportion to its obligations that the Company
17SUNSHINE HOMES DEVELOPMENT JOINT STOCK COMPANY FORM B 09a-DN/HN
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
will have to perform in the future. When the revenue recognition conditions are satisfied, unearned revenue
will be recognized in the consolidated income statement for the period corresponding to the portion that
meets the revenue recognition conditions.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from real estate
Revenue from the sale of real estate which the Company is the investor is recognised when all five (5)
following conditions are satisfied:
C
(a) the real estate has been completed and transferred to the buyer, the Company has transferred to the
buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the real estate; ,^
(b) the Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with -
ownership nor effective control over the real estate sold;
(c) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
(d) the economic benefits associated with the transaction flowed or will flow to the Company; and
(e) the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
For real estate in which the Company is an investor; the client has the right to complete the interior of the
real estate and the Company performs the interior completion of the property in accordance with the
customer's designs and requirements. The Company recognizes as revenue upon completion, handing over
the raw construction to the customers when all five (5) of the same conditions are met.
Revenue from services rendered
Revenue of a transaction involving the rendering of services is recognized when the outcome of such
transactions can be measured reliably. Where a transaction involving the rendering of services is
attributable to several periods, revenue is recognized in each period by reference to the percentage of
completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date of that period. The outcome of a transaction can be
measured reliably when all four (4) following conditions are satisfied:
(a) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
(b) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company;
(c) the percentage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably; and
(d) the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured
reliably.
Interest income and gain from investments
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the applicable
interest rate.
Income from investments is recognized when the Company has the right to receive the interest.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognized in the consolidated income statement in the period when incurred unless
they are capitalized in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standard No. 16 “Borrowing costs”.
Accordingly, borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period to get ready for their intended
use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until the assets are substantially ready for their intended
use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their
expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the cost of those assets. For specific borrowings for
construction of fixed assets and investment properties, borrowing costs are capitalized even when the
construction period is under 12 months.
18SUNSHINE HOMES DEVELOPMENT JOINT STOCK COMPANY FORM B09a-DN/HN
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit before
tax as reported in the consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that
are taxable or deductible in other periods (including loss carried forward, if any) and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. z
Deferred tax is recognized on significant differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the consolidation financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable r
profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally
recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilised. -
As at 30 June 2025, HungThinh Phat Housing Investment Company Limited - a subsidiary of the Company
has losses that can be carried forward to offset against future taxable income within 5 years. The Company
has not recognized deferred income tax assets for this tax loss due to uncertainty about future profits.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled
or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority
and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The determination of the tax currently payable is based on the current interpretation of tax regulations.
However, these regulations are subject to periodic variation and their ultimate determination depends on
the results of the tax authorities’s examinations.
Other taxes are paid in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in Vietnam.

June 2025 due to the fact that the General Meeting of Shareholders of the Company has not decided the
rate of appropriation for Bonus and welfare funds for the period. Such appropriation for Bonus and welfare
funds might decrease item "Profit attributable to shareholders owning common shares"; thus, decrease in
"Basic earnings per share".
