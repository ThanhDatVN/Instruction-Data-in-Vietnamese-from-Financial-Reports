Report on the separate financial statements
We have audited the accompanying separate financial statements of SaoBacDau Technologies Corporation
(hereinafter referred to as “the Company") prepared on 12 June 2025 as set out from page 05 to page 42,
which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 March 2025, and the income statement, and cash­
flow statement for the financial year then ended, and the notes to the financial statements.
Management's Responsibility
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these separate financial statements in
accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards and Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and
relevant legislation as to the preparation and presentation of financial statements and for such internal control
as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of the separate financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors' Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these separate financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the separate financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
separate financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the separate financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation and fair presentation of the separate financial statements in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the separate financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit qualified opinion.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
Basis for Qualified Opinion
As at the date of issuing the independent auditor’s report, we had not obtained sufficient confirmation for the
non-current trade receivables as at 31 March 2025 amounting to VND 19.16 billion. With the Company’s
existing documentation, we were also unable to perform alternative procedures to verify the non-current trade
receivables as at 31 March 2025 and their possible effects on the financial statements. As a result, we were
unable to determine whether any adjustments to these balances were necessary.

paragraph, the accompanying separate financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position
of SaoBacDau Technologies Corporation as at 31 March 2025, and of the results of its financial performance

Standards, Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System, and prevailing accounting regulations in

results of operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles and practices generally
accepted in countries and jurisdictions other than Vietnam.
2.2. Forms of accounting records
The form of accounting records applied in the Company is the General Journal.

year ended 31 March 2025. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge
of all relevant information available at the date when the separate financial statements are prepared,
this does not prevent actual figures differing from estimates.
3.3. Cash and cash equivalents

outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term at a constant

Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis
as owned assets. Estimated depreciation period for machinery is from 3 to 4 years.

income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term regardless of payment methods.
Depreciation of assets subject to operating leases is consistent with the depreciation policy of the

which at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax
loss);
■ All taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and
associates, and interests in joint ventures when the parent, investor or venturer is able to control
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. //
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be \
utilised, unless:
■ The deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction
which at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss);
■ The deferred tax assets for all deductible temporary differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint ventures are only recognised when it >
is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future; and taxable profit
will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. /
The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset shall be reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the
benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilised. Any such reduction shall be reverted to
the extent it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.
