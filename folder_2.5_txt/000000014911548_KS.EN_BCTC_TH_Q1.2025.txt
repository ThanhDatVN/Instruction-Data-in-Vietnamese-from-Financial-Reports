transact at the time the transaction occurs.
• For transactions involving the purchase of assets or expenses paid immediately in foreign
currency (not through payable accounts): the bank's buying exchange rate of foreign currency
where the Company makes the payment.

currencies at the end of the financial period is determined according to the following principles:
• For foreign currency deposits in banks: the buying exchange rate of the foreign currency at the
bank where the Company holds its foreign currency account.

reduction in the value of the investment itself. Dividends and profits from periods after the
acquisition of the investment are recognized as revenue. Dividends received in the form of
additional shares are only tracked in terms of the number of additional shares, with no recognition
of the value of the shares received.
Provision for Impairment of Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates
A provision for impairment of investments in subsidiaries and associates is recognized when the
subsidiary' or associate incurs losses. The provision is calculated as the difference between the
actual investment capital in the subsidiary or associate and the actual equity, multiplied by the

loss that may occur, as follows:
• For overdue receivables:

50% of the value for receivables overdue from 1 year to under 2 years.
