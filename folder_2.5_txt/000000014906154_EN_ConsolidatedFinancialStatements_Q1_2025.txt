Notes to the Financial Statements (coni.)
3. Basis for preparing consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared based on the consolidation of the
separate financial statements of the Company and the financial statements of subsidiaries (the
subsidiaries) controlled by the Company for the accounting period from 01/01/2025 to 31/03/2025.
The accounting policies that applied in the subsidiaries' financial statements are consistent with those
in the Company's. If necessary, the subsidiaries' financial statements will be adjusted to ensure
consistency in the Company's and its subsidiaries' accounting policies.
The operating results of subsidiaries bought or sold in the period are presented in the consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition or to the date of sale of investments in that company.
When consolidating the Financial Statements, the balance, major income and expenses including
unrealized gains and losses arising from internal transactions are eliminated.
Non-controlling interests are the interest in the profit or losses, and in the subsidiary's net assets that
are not owned by the Company. These interests are presented separately in the Consolidated Income
Statement and the Owners' equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, apart from the
shareholders' equity.
Losses arising at the subsidiary are allocated in proportion with the shares of the non-controlling
shareholders, even if such losses are greater than the non-controlling shareholders' proportionate
share of the subsidiary's net assets.
Goodwill (or bargain purchase gain) arising from the purchase of a subsidiary is the difference
between the cost of the investment and the fair value of the realizable net assets of the subsidiary at ;
the acquisition date. Goodwill is allocated gradually over its estimated useful life, which should not
exceed 10 years. The Company periodically reassesses the impairment of goodwill. If there is j(
evidence that the impairment of goodwill is greater than the annual allocation, the amount of
impairment will be allocated in the reporting period.
