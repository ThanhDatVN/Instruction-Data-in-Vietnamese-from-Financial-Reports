25. The principle and method of recording current enterprise income tax, deferred enterprise income tax
expense - Enterprise income tax represents the total value of the current tax payable and the deferred tax
amount.
- The current tax amount payable is calculated based on taxable income for the year. Taxable income differs
from pre-tax profit as reported in the income statement because taxable income does not include income or
expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years (including including carry-forward losses, if any) and in
addition does not include non-taxable or non-deductible items.
- Deferred income tax is calculated on the differences between the book value and the income tax base of
asset or liability items on the financial statements and is recorded according to the Balance Sheet method,
maths. Deferred tax liabilities must be recognized for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognized only when it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profit to offset the difference,
temporary deviation.
- Deferred income tax is determined at the tax rate expected to apply in the year the asset is recovered or the
liability is settled. Deferred income tax is recognized in the income statement and recorded in equity only
when the tax is related to items recorded directly in equity.
- Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when the Company has a legally enforceable right
to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the assets Deferred tax assets and deferred
tax liabilities relate to corporate income taxes administered by the same tax authority and the Company
intends to pay current income taxes on a net basis.
- The determination of the Company's income tax is based on current tax regulations. However, these
regulations change from time to time and the final determination of corporate income tax depends on the
inspection results of the competent tax authority

Re: Explanation of profit from loss in
quarter 2.2024 to proft in quarter 2.2025
To: STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION
HANOI STOCK EXCHANGE
Domenal Joint Stock Company respectfully explains the profit after tax from loss in the
second quarter of 2024 to profit in the second quarter of 2025 as follows:
The Company has not fully provisioned for doubtful debts for many years. By the second
quarter of 2024, the Company had made provisions for doubtful debts in accordance with
regulations, which caused the company's management costs to increase significantly and the
business results in the second quarter of 2024 were at a loss.
In the second quarter of 2025, the Company did not incur any bad debts, its business
activities were effective as planned, so the business results in the second quarter of 2025 were
profitable
Sincerely!
