REVIEW REPORT ON INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
THE SHAREHOLDERS, THE BOARD OF DERECTORS AND THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
VINACONEX INVESTMENT AND TOURISM DEVELOPMENT JOINT STOCK COMPANY
We have reviewed the accompanying Interim Combined Financial Statements of Vinaconex
Investment and Tourism Development Joint Stock Company (hereinafter referred to as “the
Company”), which were prepared on 22 July 2025, from page 6 to page 30, including the Interim
Combined Balance Sheet as at 30 June 2025, the Interim Combined Income Statement, the Interim
Combined Cash Flow Statement for the first 6 months of the fiscal year ended 31 December 2025 and
the Notes to the Interim Combined Financial Statements.
Responsibility of the Board of Management
The Company’s Board of Management is responsible for the preparation, true and fair presentation of
the Interim Combined Financial Statements of the Company in accordance with the Vietnamese
Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting System and relevant statutory
requirements on the preparation and presentation of Interim Combined Financial Statements; and
responsible for the internal control as the Board of Management determines necessary to enable the
preparation and presentation of the Interim Combined Financial Statements to be free from material
misstatement due to fraud or error.
Responsibility of Auditors
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Interim Combined Financial Statements based on
our review. We conducted our review in accordance with the Vietnamese Standard on Review
Engagements No. 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity.
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Vietnamese Standards on
Auditing and therefore, it does not enable us to obtain a reasonable assurance that we would become
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express our
audit opinion.

Conclusion of Auditors
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
Interim Combined Financial Statements do not give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the
financial position as at 30 June 2025 of Vinaconex Investment and Tourism Development Joint Stock
Company, its financial performance and its cash flows for the first 6 months of the fiscal year ended 31
December 2025 in accordance with the Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise
Accounting System and relevant statutory requirements on the preparation and presentation of Interim
Combined Financial Statements.
Emphasis of matter
Without qualifying our conclusion, we draw attention to Note VIII.3 in the Notes to the Interim
Combined Financial Statements, which discloses the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The matters as set forth in Note VIII.3 indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast
significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Other matter
The Auditor’s Report on the Company's Interim Combined Financial Statements for the first 6 months
of the fiscal year ended 31 December 2025 has been prepared in both Vietnamese and English. In the
event of any discrepancy between the two versions, the Vietnamese version shall prevail.

Notes to the Interim Combined Financial Statements (cont.)
2. Segment information
The Company does not present segment reporting because its operations are primarily concentrated
within the real estate trading segment and are conducted in a single geographical location within
the territory of Vietnam.
3. Going-concern assumption
For the first 6 months of the fiscal year ended 31 December 2025, the Company continued to incur
a net loss of VND 10,605,747,420, and its accumulated loss as at 3 0 June 2025 amounted to VND
550,416,843,153. Furthermore, as at 30 June 2025, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded its
current assets by VND 1,83 8,869,137,423. These factors may affect the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern.
However, the Company’s liabilities are primarily those payable to Vietnam Construction and Import
- Export Joint Stock Corporation (“Parent Company”). On 1 July 2025, the Company and its Parent
Company entered into three agreements, allowing a 120-day payment extension for the whole
outstanding debt, effective from 1 July 2025. On 16 July 2025, Prosperity Joint Stock Commercial X
Bank (“VPBank”) issued three letters of guarantee, effective from the issuance date to 8 November V
2025, to secure the Company's full payment obligations to its Parent Company. The Board of
Management believes that the Company is capable of mobilizing timely financial support from the 7
Bank and other partners to continue its operations. Consequently, the Company’s Interim
Combined Financial Statements for the first 6 months of the fiscal year ended 31 December 2025
have been prepared on a going-concern basis.
