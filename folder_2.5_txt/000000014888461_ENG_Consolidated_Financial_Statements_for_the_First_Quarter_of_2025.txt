REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
To: THE SHAREHOLDERS, THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF GENERAL
DIRECTORS
KHANH HOA SANEST SOFT DRINK JOINT STOCK COMPANY ^
We have reviewed the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Khanh Hoa Sanest Soft Drink
Joint Stock Company (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”), which were prepared on 25 April 2025 from
5 to page 35 including the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 31 March 2025, the Consolidated Income
Statement, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending 31 December
2025 and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Responsibility of the Board of General Directors
The Company’s Board of General Directors is responsible for the preparation, true and fair presentation of the
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese
Enterprise Accounting System and relevant statutory requirements on the preparation and presentation of the
Consolidated Financial Statements; and responsible for the internal control as the Company’s Board of
General Directors determines necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated
Financial Statements to be free from material misstatement due to fraud or error.
Responsibility of Auditors
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on our review.
We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Review Engagements 2410 - Review
of Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Company, scope of these
principles can be applicable to review engagement of historical finance information performed by Independent
Auditor of the Company.
A review of financial information involves performing inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial
and accounting matters, and applying analytical procedures and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters
that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion of auditor
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements do not give a true and fair view of the financial positions in all material
respect, financial performance as of 31 March 2025 of the Group, its consolidated business results and its
consolidated cash flows for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending 31 December 2025, in accordance with
the Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting System and relevant statutory
requirements on the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
