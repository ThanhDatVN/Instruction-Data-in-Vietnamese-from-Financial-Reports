2 . ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING PRACTICES APPLIED BY THE COMPANY
2.1 . Accounting Period and Currency Used in Accounting
The company's accounting period follows the calendar year, starting from January 1st and ending on December
31 st each year.
The currency used for accounting entries is the Vietnamese Dong (VND).
2.2 . Applicable Accounting Standards and Regulations
Accounting Standards Applied
The company applies the Corporate Accounting Regime issued under Circular No. 200/2014/TT-BTC dated
December 22, 2014, by the Ministry of Finance, and Circular No. 53/2016/TT-BTC dated March 21, 2016, by
the Ministry of Finance, which amends and supplements certain provisions of Circular No. 200/2014/TT-BTC.
Statement of Compliance with Accounting Standards and Regulations
The company has adopted the Vietnamese Accounting Standards and other related legal documents issued by
the state. The financial statements are prepared and presented in full compliance with the regulations of each
applicable standard, circulars guiding the implementation of the standards, and the corporate accounting regime
2.3 . Basis for Preparing Separate Financial Statements
The separate financial statements are presented on the historical cost basis.
The company's separate financial statements are prepared based on the consolidation of financial reports from
independent accounting units and the company's office.
In the company's separate financial statements, all transactions and balances related to internal assets, liabilities,
receivables, payables, etc., have been completely eliminated.
Users of these separate financial statements should read them in conjunction with the company's consolidated
financial statements and those of its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, in order to
obtain a full understanding of the financial situation, business performance, and cash flows of the entire
company.
2.4 . Accounting estimates
The preparation of the separate financial statements complies with the Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the
Corporate Accounting Regime of Vietnam, and other legal regulations related to the preparation and
presentation of the separate financial statements. This requires the Board of Directors to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts of liabilities, assets, and the presentation of contingent liabilities and assets
as of the end of the accounting period, as well as revenue and expenses throughout the accounting period.
The key estimates and assumptions in the separate financial statements include:
Provision for doubtful receivables;
Provision for inventory impairment;
Estimation of prepaid expenses allocation;
Estimated useful life of fixed assets;
Classification and provision for financial investments;
Corporate income tax estimation.
These estimates and assumptions are regularly evaluated based on past experience and other factors, including
future assumptions that are materially significant to the company's financial statements and are considered
reasonable by the company's Board of Directors.SONG DA 2 JOINT STOCK COMPANY

2.5 . Financial Instruments
Initial Recognition
Financial Assets
The company's financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, receivables from customers and others, loans,
short-term and long-term investments. Upon initial recognition, financial assets are measured at purchase
cost/issue cost, plus other directly attributable costs related to the purchase or issuance of the financial asset.
Financial Liabilities
The company's financial liabilities include borrowings, payables to vendors, other payables, and accrued
expenses. Upon initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at issue cost, plus other costs directly
related to the issuance of those financial liabilities.
Post-Initial Recognition Value
Financial assets and financial liabilities have not been measured at fair value as of the end of the accounting
period because Circular No. 210/2009/TT-BTC and other current regulations require the presentation of
financial statements and disclosures regarding financial instruments, but do not provide equivalent guidance on
how to assess and recognize the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
2.6 . Foreign Currency Transactions
Foreign currency transactions during the fiscal year are converted into Vietnamese Dong at the actual exchange
rate on the transaction date.
The exchange rate used when revaluing foreign currency monetary items at the time of preparing the separate
financial statements is determined as follows:
For foreign currency deposits: the purchase rate of the bank where the company holds the foreign
All exchange rate differences arising during the year and differences from revaluing foreign currency monetary
items at the reporting date are recorded in the operating results for the fiscal year.
2.7 . Cash
Cash includes cash on hand and non-term bank deposits.
2.8 . Financial Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are initially recognized on the books at cost. After initial recognition, the value of
these investments is determined at cost less any impairment provisions.
Investments in equity instruments of other entities, which do not confer control, joint control, or significant
influence over the investee, are initially recorded at cost. After initial recognition, the value of these
investments is determined at cost less any impairment provisions.
Impairment provisions for investments are made at the end of the year as follows:
For investments in subsidiaries: The impairment provision is made when the investee company incurs a
loss, based on the investee's financial statements at the time of making the provision.
For long-term investments (not classified as trading securities) where the company has no significant
influence over the investee: If the investment's fair value cannot be determined at the reporting date, the
provision is based on the investee's financial statements at the time of making the provision.SONG DA 2 JOINT STOCK COMPANY

Ha Dong District, Hanoi City Second Quarter of 2025
2.9 . Receivables
Receivables are tracked in detail by maturity, debtor, type of receivable, and other management needs.
Receivables are classified as short-term and long-term in the separate financial statements based on the
remaining maturity of the receivables at the reporting date.
Provision for doubtful receivables is made for overdue receivables according to contractual terms, loan
agreements, or other commitments. This provision is based on the overdue payment time as per the original sale
contract, excluding any extension of the debt. Also, provisions are made for receivables that are not yet due but
are likely to be unrecoverable due to circumstances such as the debtor's bankruptcy or liquidation.
2.10 . Inventory
Inventory is initially recorded at cost, which includes purchase costs, processing costs, and other directly
attributable costs to bring the inventory to its location and condition at initial recognition. After initial
recognition, if the net realizable value of inventory is less than cost, the inventory is recorded at its net
realizable value.
Net realizable value is estimated based on the expected selling price of the inventory minus estimated costs to
complete and sell the product.
Inventory value is determined using the weighted average method.
Inventory is accounted for using the perpetual inventory method.
The method for determining the value of work in progress at the end of the year: The production costs of
unfinished business are accumulated for each project that has not yet been completed or recognized as revenue,
corresponding to the remaining work at year-end.
Provisions for inventory impairment are made at the end of the year as the difference between the cost and the
net realizable value of the inventory.
2.11 . Fixed Assets
Tangible and intangible fixed assets are initially recorded at cost. During usage, tangible and intangible fixed
assets are recorded at their original cost, accumulated depreciation, and residual value.
Post-Initial Recognition Value
If any costs result in higher future economic benefits from using tangible fixed assets beyond the initial
evaluation, these costs are capitalized as an additional part of the asset's original cost.
Other costs incurred after the asset is put into operation, such as repair, maintenance, and overhaul costs, are
recorded in the income statement for the year in which they arise.
Depreciation of fixed assets is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as
follows:
Buildings and structures 30 years
Machinery and equipment 05-10 years
Transport and communication equipment 06-10 years
Management tools and instruments 03 - 05 yearsSONG DA 2 JOINT STOCK COMPANY

Ha Dong District, Hanoi City Second Quarter of 2025
2.12 . Operating Lease
An operating lease is a type of lease for fixed assets where the majority of risks and benefits related to
ownership of the asset belong to the lessor. Payments under an operating lease are accounted for in the income
statement using the straight-line method based on the lease term.
2.13 . Prepaid Expenses
Expenses that have been incurred but relate to future financial periods are accounted for as prepaid expenses
and gradually allocated to the income statement in subsequent fiscal years.
The allocation of long-term prepaid expenses into operating costs for each fiscal year is based on the nature and
magnitude of each type of expense to determine a reasonable method and criteria for allocation.
The company’s prepaid expenses include:
Tools and Equipment: These are assets held by the company for use in its regular business operations,
where the cost of each asset is less than 30 million VND, and thus do not qualify as fixed assets under
current regulations. The cost of tools and equipment is allocated using the straight-line method over a
period of 1 to 3 years.
Other Prepaid Expenses: These are recorded at their original cost and allocated using the straight-line
method over a useful life of 1 to 3 years.
2.14 . Accounts Payable
Accounts payable are tracked by their due dates, the party to whom the payment is owed, the type of currency in
which the liability is denominated, and other factors based on the company’s management needs. Liabilities are
classified as current or non-current on the balance sheet based on the remaining term of payment as of the
2.15 . Loans
Loans are tracked by the lender, the loan agreement, and the repayment term. In the case of foreign currency-
loans, the details are tracked in the original currency.
2.16 . Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they arise, except for costs directly related
to the construction or production of an asset under construction, which are capitalized into the value of the asset
when all conditions outlined in Vietnamese Accounting Standard No. 16 “Borrowing Costs” are met.
Additionally, interest on loans for constructing fixed assets or investment properties is capitalized even when
the construction period is less than 12 months.
2.17 . Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses refer to amounts owed for goods or services received from suppliers or provided to
customers during the reporting year but not yet paid, as well as other accrued costs like those related to
construction. These expenses are recognized in the period in which they occur.
The recognition of accrued expenses follows the matching principle, ensuring they align with the revenues
generated during the period. The actual costs will be reconciled, and any difference between the provision and
the actual cost is adjusted accordingly.SONG DA 2 JOINT STOCK COMPANY

The owner's investment capital is recorded based on the actual capital contributed by the owner.
The share premium reflects the difference between the par value, direct costs related to the issuance of shares,

surplus (if the issue price is higher than the par value and the direct issuance costs) or a negative surplus (if the
issue price is lower than the par value and the direct issuance costs).
Retained earnings reflect the business results (profits or losses) after corporate income tax and the distribution
or handling of profits or losses by the company.
Dividends payable to shareholders are recognized as a liability on the company’s balance sheet after the board
of directors has announced the dividend distribution and the date of record for dividend entitlement is
confirmed by the Vietnam Securities Depository.
2.20 . Sales and Service Revenue
Revenue is recognized when the company has the ability to receive economic benefits that can be reliably
determined. Revenue is measured based on the fair value of amounts collected or to be collected, after

to the buyer;

The revenue can be reliably measured.
2.21 . Cost of Goods Sold and Services Provided
The cost of goods sold and services provided includes the total costs incurred for finished products, goods,
materials sold, and services provided to customers in the year. These costs are recognized in accordance with
the revenue generated during the year and in compliance with the prudence principle. Any wastage of materials
exceeding the standard, costs beyond the normal level, labor costs, and fixed overheads that are not allocated to
inventory values are fully and timely recorded as the cost of goods sold in the year, even if the products or
goods are not yet determined as consumed.SONG DA 2 JOINT STOCK COMPANY

has established control systems to ensure a reasonable balance between the risk costs incurred and risk
management expenses. The General Management is responsible for overseeing the risk management process to
ensure a reasonable balance between risks and controls.
Market Risk
The company may face market risks such as interest rates.
Interest Rate Risk
The company is exposed to interest rate risks because the fair value of future cash flows from financial
instruments fluctuates with market interest rate changes, especially when there are deposits with or without
maturity, loans, and interest-bearing debts with floating rates. The company manages interest rate risks by
analyzing market competition to obtain favorable rates.SONG DA 2 JOINT STOCK COMPANY

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to fulfill its obligations, leading to a financial loss for the
company. The company faces credit risks from business activities (mainly receivables) and financial operations
(including bank deposits, loans, and other financial instruments).

funds. Liquidity risks mainly come from the different maturity dates of financial assets and liabilities.
