income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized.

income tax is also recognized in equity.

offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to

tax liabilities on a net basis

The Company did not yet assessed the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities as at
the balance sheet date because Circular No. 210/2009/TT-BTC issued by the Ministry of Finance on
November 6, 2009 (“Circular 210“) as well as current regulations had not provided specific guidance
on determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities. Circular 210 required the
application of International Financial Reporting Standards on the presentation of financial statements
and disclosure of information for financial instruments but did not provide equivalent guidance for the
measurement and recognition of financial instruments including the application of fair value, in order
to be consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards.
6.6. Financial risk management objectives
The Company established a risk management system to identify and assess the risks to which the
Company was exposed, and to establish policies and procedures to control risks at an acceptable
level. The risk management system was reviewed periodically to reflect changes in market conditions
and the Company's operations.
Financial risks include market risk (including exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit
risk and liquidity risk.
45Form No. B 09 - DN
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Market risk
The Company's business operations would be primarily exposed to risks from changes in exchange
rates, interest rates and prices. The Company did not hedge these risks due to the lack of an active
market for trading these financial instruments.
Exchange rate risk management
The Company conducted a number of transactions denominated in foreign currencies, which would
expose the Company to risks of exchange rate fluctuations.
Interest risk management
The Company was exposed to interest rate risks arising from interest-bearing loans it had entered.
This risk would be managed by the Company by maintaining an appropriate level of borrowings and
analyzing the competitive market situation to obtain favorable interest rates for the Company from
appropriate lending sources.
Good price risk management
The company purchased raw materials and goods from domestic and foreign suppliers to serve
production and business activities. Therefore, the Company would bear the risk of changes in selling
prices of raw materials and goods.
Credit risk
Credit risk occurred when a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, resulting
in financial losses to the Company. The Company had a suitable credit policy and regularly monitors
the situation to assess whether the Company was exposed to credit risk. The Company did not have
any significant credit risk exposure to customers or counterparties because the receivables arose from
a large number of customers operating in diverse industries and distributed across different
geographical areas.
Liquidity risk management
The purpose of liquidity risk management was to ensure adequate funds were available to meet current
and future financial obligations. Liquidity was also managed by the Company to ensure that the excess
of maturing liabilities over maturing assets in any period was kept to manageable levels relative to the
amount of funds that the Company believes could be generated within that period. It was the
Company's policy to regularly monitor current and expected liquidity requirements to ensure that the
Company maintained adequate levels of cash reserves, borrowings and committed capital from
owners to meet its current and non-current liquidity requirements.
The tables below detail the remaining contractual maturities for non-derivative financial assets and
financial liabilities and their agreed repayment terms. The tables have been drawn up based on the
undiscounted cash flows of financial assets and undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based
on the earliest date on which the Company can be required to pay. The disclosure of information on
non-derivative financial assets is necessary in order to understand the Company’s liquidity risk
management as liquidity was managed on a net asset and liability basis.
