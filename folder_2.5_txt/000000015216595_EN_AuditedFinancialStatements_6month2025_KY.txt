REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Í
To: Shareholders
The Board of Directors and the Board of Management
r
Petec Trading and Investment Corporation
We have reviewed the accompanying interim financial statements of Petec Trading and Investment
Corporation ("the Corporation”), prepared on 23 July 2025 as set out from page 05 to 34, which comprise
I
the interim balance sheet as at 30 June 2025, the interim income statement, interim cash flows statement
for the period from 01 January 2025 to 30 June 2025 and the Notes to the interim financial statements.

The Board of Management’s Responsibility
I
The Board of Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these interim
: financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese accounting standards, corporate accounting system
and the statutory requirements relevant applicable to the preparation and presentation of interim
I financial statements and for such internal control as the Board of Management determines is necessary
to enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
ị Our responsibility is to express an conclusion on these interim financial statements based on our review.
We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Review Engagements 2410 -
[ Review of Interim Financial Information Perpormed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. ^
1 A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of person responsible for CO
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is ^h
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on |£
Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all s h
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Basis for Qualified Conclusion
The Corporation recorded the other receivable of VND 169,785,513,359 from Vietnam Oil and Gas
Group (now is Vietnam National Industry - Energy Group), this other receivable related to the recovery of
the accumulated losses incurred until 18 May 2011 (when the Corporation changed its ownership into a
joint stock company), the other receivable arised from the determination of the State-owned capital
contribution as at 18 May 2011, nevertheless, has not been approved and finalized by the Vietnam Oil
and Gas Group and competent authorities. We did not have sufficient information on the amount will be
approved and the difference (if any) compared to the value of other receivables recorded above. So, we
were unanble to access the impact of the above matter on the Corporation’s financial statements for the
period from 01 January 2025 to 30 June 2025.
Qualified Conclusion
Based on our review, except for the effect of the matter decribed in the "Basis for Qualified Conclusion”
paragraph, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim
financial statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation
as at 30 June 2025, its financial performance and its cash flows for the period from 01 January 2025 to
30 June 2025, in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, corporate accounting system and
the statutory requirements relevant applicable to the preparation and presentation of interim financial
statements.

Partnering for SuccessEmphasis of Matters
As stated in Note No. 15 of the Notes to the interim financial statements: The balance of construction-in-
f
progress costs for the Phase 2 Construction Project of PETEC Cai Mep Oil Depot under the Corporation
is VND 56,164,171,321. This project has been suspended since 2012 following Document No. 7524/TB-
I
DKVN dated 25 September 2012, issued by the Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group, which directed the
suspension or delay of all basic construction investments, allowing only essential investments for fuel
trading operations in 2012. To date, the Corporation has not received guidance from the Parent
Company regarding the next steps for this construction project.
As stated in Note No. 10 of the Notes to the interim financial statements: the balance of geographical
I location advantages cost as at 30 June 2025 was VND 135.6 billion (increasing in the enterprise value
during the equitization process) including the geographical location advantages of land lots with land rent
I offset, as well as land lots with definite lease terms and land lots without lease terms. For this period, the
Corporation has sent an official letter requesting to the Ministry of Finance to seek guidance on the
ị allocation geographical location advantages (including land lots with definite lease terms and land lots
without lease terms), the Corporation has not received a response from the Ministry of Finance. In
I preparing these interim financial statements for the six-month period ended 30 June 2025, the
Corporation has not allocated the costs of the aforementioned geographical location advantages.
As stated in Note No. 4.1 of the Notes to the interim financial statements: As at 30 June 2025, the
Corporation had accumulated losses of approximately VND 1,819 billion and its current liabilities
I
exceeding its current assets by approximately VND 169.153 billion (as at 31 December 2024: VND
1,808.572 billion and VND 181.12 billion, respectively), in which, short-term trade payables to the Parent
Company - PetroVietnam Oil Corporation and its subsidiaries amount to VND 439.590 billion. These
issues indicate that the Corporation is facing difficulties in settling due debts; the ability of the
I
Corporation to meet its short-term obligations in the future depends on generating future profits, securing
financial resources, and receiving support from the parent company - PetroVietnam Oil Corporation to
maintain its business operations. The Corporation’s Management affirms that these issues do not affect
the Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern.

its current liabilities exceeding its current assets by approximately VND 169.153 billion (as at 31
December 2024: VND 1,808.572 billion and VND 181.12 billion, respectively), in which, short-term
trade payables to the Parent Company - PetroVietnam Oil Corporation and its subsidiaries amount to
VND 439.590 billion. These issues indicate that the Corporation is facing difficulties in settling due
debts. So the Corporation's short-term liquidity over the 12 months following 30 June 2025 depends on
its ability to generate profits in the future, arrange financial resources and support from the parent
company - PetroVietnam Oil Corporation to sustain its business operations. The Board of Directors

(*) This represents the geographic location advantage related to land leased with annual payments,

which was recognized as an increase in the enterprise value during the equitization process on18 May
2011. Since 2016, the Corporation has ceased allocating the value of the geographic location

advantage to business expenses and has instead offset it with the annual land rental payments for the
some land. Since 2022, the Corporation has been allocating the business advantage in accordance
with the provisions of Decree No. 140/2020/ND-CP dated 30 November 2020, amending and
supplementing certain provisions of Decree No. 126/2017/ND-CP dated 16 November 2017, regarding
the transformation of state-owned enterprises and 100% state-owned single-member limited liability
companies into joint-stock companies as follows: “Enterprises that were equitized before the effective
date of Decree No. 59/2011/ND-CP of the Government, dated 18 July 2011, which included the value
of leased land location advantages in the enterprise value and recorded the increase in state capital at
the enterprise, but have not yet fully allocated it to production and business expenses, and have not
yet offset it against land rental payments, shall allocate the remaining value of the geographic location
advantage to business expenses for corporate income tax purposes over a period not exceeding 3
years from the effective date of Decree No. 140/2020/ND-CP. The annual allocation shall not result in
a loss for the joint-stock company’s business operations. After 3 years, the joint-stock company will
continue to allocate the remaining value (if any) to expenses, but it will not be deductible when
calculating taxable income. The joint-stock company is obligated to pay land rent according to the law
on land”. The Corporation continues to allocate the geographic location advantage costs for land lots
with land rent deduction. In this period, the Corporation has sent an official letter to the Ministry of
Finance requesting guidance on the allocation of geographical location advantages costs for these
land lots, so The Corporation has temporarily not allocated this geographical location advantage to its
business results for the period.
