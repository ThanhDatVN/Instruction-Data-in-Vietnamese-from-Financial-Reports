to sell them.
The value of inventory is determined using the weighted average method and is accounted for
using the perpetual inventory system.
A provision for inventory devaluation is established for each inventory item whose cost exceeds its
net realizable value. For unfinished services, the provision is determined based on each type of
service with a separate pricing structure. Increases or decreases in the provision for inventory
devaluation that need to be recognized at the financial year-end are recorded in cost of goods sold.

12. Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive)
arising from a past event, and the settlement of this obligation is expected to result in an outflow of
economic benefits, with the value of the obligation being reliably estimated.
If the time value is material, the provision will be determined by discounting the future amount
required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate, reflecting current market assessments
of the time value of money and the specific risks of the obligation. The increase in the provision
due to the passage of time is recognized as a financial expense.
The Company's provisions payable include:
Provision for product warranties

commitments.

weighted probability of all possible outcomes with their corresponding probabilities. Increases or
decreases in the warranty provision that need to be recognized at the financial year-end are
recorded as selling expenses.

Address: Xuan Thuong 1 Residential Group, Pliuc Thang Ward, Phuc Yen City, Vinh Phuc Province, Vietnam
NOTE TO THE INTERIM COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
as at 31 March 2025 and for the three-month period then ended
In cases where products, goods, or services have been sold in previous periods, and trade discounts,
sales discounts, or sales returns occur in a later period, the company is allowed to reduce revenue
based on the principle of adjusting the revenue in the period in which the discount, allowance, or
return is recognized:
+ If products, goods, or services that were consumed in previous periods require a price reduction,
a trade discount, or are returned, but the events occur before the financial report is issued,
accounting must treat this as an event requiring adjustment after the balance sheet date and reduce
revenue in the financial statements of the reporting period (the previous period).
+ In the case where products, goods, or services are subject to price reductions, trade discounts, or
returns after the financial report has been issued, the company must reduce the revenue of the
period in which the event occurs (the subsequent period).
18. Cost of Goods Sold
The cost of goods sold for the year is recognized in accordance with the revenue generated during
the period and ensures compliance with the prudence principle.
For direct material costs that exceed normal consumption, labor costs, and fixed production
overheads that are not allocated to the value of goods in inventory, accounting must immediately
include them in the cost of goods sold (after deducting any compensation, if applicable), even

• Purchased or created primarily for the purpose of selling in the short term;
• The company intends to hold them for the purpose of short-term profit;
• Derivative financial instruments (except for derivative financial instruments designated as a
financial guarantee contract or an effective hedging instrument).
Held-to-maturity investments

payments and a fixed maturity date that the company intends and has the ability to hold until
maturity.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that

available for sale or are not classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or
loss, held-to-maturity investments, or loans and receivables.

initial recognition, the financial asset is determined at the purchase price/issuance cost plus any
other costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of the financial asset.
b) Financial liabilities

NOTE TO THE INTERIM COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Financial liabilities are classified as held-for-trading securities if:
• Issued or created primarily for the purpose of repurchasing in the short term;
• The company intends to hold them for the purpose of short-term profit;
• Derivative financial instruments (except for derivative financial instruments designated as a
financial guarantee contract or an effective hedging instrument).
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are determined by the initial carrying amount of the
financial liability, less any principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization of the
difference between the initial carrying amount and the maturity value, calculated using the
effective interest method, less any impairments (either directly or through the use of a provision
account) due to a decrease in value or non-recovery.
The effective interest method is the method used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial
liability or group of financial liabilities and allocate interest income or expense over the relevant
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows that will
be paid or received throughout the expected life of the financial instrument, or shorter if necessary,
to the net present value of the financial liability.
T
The initial carrying amount of a financial liability
At initial recognition, financial liabilities are determined at the issue price plus any directly
attributable costs incurred in issuing the financial liability. <
c) Equity instruments
Equity instruments are contracts that represent a residual interest in the assets of the company after
deducting all liabilities.

V.6; V.15; V16; V.19; V.20.
2. Financial Risk Management
The Company's operations give rise to the following financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk, and
market risk. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing policies and controls to mitigate
financial risks, as well as overseeing the implementation of the established policies and controls.
A, Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party involved in a contract is unable to fulfill its obligations,
resulting in financial losses for the Company.
The Company faces credit risks primarily arising from accounts receivable from customers and
bank deposits.
Accounts receivable from customers
The Company minimizes credit risk by only engaging in transactions with financially stable
entities, requiring the opening of letters of credit or securing assets for first-time or unknown
financial entities. Additionally, the accounts receivable staff regularly monitors outstanding debts
to expedite collections.
The Company's accounts receivable from customers are related to multiple entities and individuals,
so the credit risk concentration for accounts receivable is low.
Term deposits
The Company's term and non-term bank deposits are placed at domestic banks. The Board of
Directors does not perceive any significant credit risk from these deposits.
Loans
The Company lends money to its subsidiaries and key management members. These entities and
individuals are all reputable and have good payment capacity, so the credit risk for the loans is
low.
B, Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the company faces difficulties in meeting its financial obligations due
to a lack of cash.
The Board of General Directors is ultimately responsible for managing liquidity risk. The
company's liquidity risk primarily arises from the mismatch in the maturity dates of financial assets
and financial liabilities.
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining an appropriate amount of cash and cash
equivalents, as well as loans at a level deemed sufficient by the Board of Directors to meet the
Company's operational needs, in order to minimize the impact of cash flow fluctuations.

The Board of Directors believes that the level of concentration risk related to debt repayment is
low. The Company has the ability to settle due debts through cash flows from operating activities
and proceeds from maturing financial assets. The Company has access to sufficient sources of
funding and loans maturing within 12 months can be rolled over with existing lenders.
C, Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
Market risk includes three types: foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and other price risks.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument
will fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates.
The company imports raw materials for production and exports products with the main transaction
currencies being USD, so it is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.
The Company manages risks related to exchange rate fluctuations by optimizing debt payment
terms, forecasting foreign exchange rates, maintaining a reasonable loan and debt structure
between foreign currencies and VND, choosing the time to buy and pay foreign currencies at low
exchange rates, and optimally using existing cash resources to balance exchange rate risks and
liquidity risks.
Commodity/raw material price risk
The Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in commodity/raw material prices. The
Company manages commodity/raw material price risk by closely monitoring relevant market
information and situations to manage purchase timing, production planning and inventory levels
appropriately.
The Company has not used derivative instruments to hedge commodity/raw material price risks.

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is reflected at the value that the financial
instrument could be exchanged for in a current transaction between knowledgeable and willing
parties.
The company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate fair value:
• The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans, other receivables,
borrowings, payables to suppliers and other short-term payables is equivalent to the book value
(less the provision for the estimated uncollectible portion) of these items due to their short
maturity.
• The fair value of held-to-maturity investments and ready-for-sale financial assets listed on the
stock market is the published transaction price at the end of the accounting period. For unlisted
held-to-maturity investments and ready-for-sale financial assets with transaction prices published
by 3 securities companies at the end of the accounting period, the fair value of these investments
is the average price based on the transaction prices published by 3 securities companies..
• The fair value of loans, trade receivables, other receivables, borrowings, trade payables and other
long-term payables, held-to-maturity investments that are not listed on the stock market and do
not have a trading price announced by 3 securities companies is estimated by discounting cash
flows at the interest rate applicable to debts with similar characteristics and remaining maturity.

The Company has not yet conducted an official valuation of unlisted available-for-sale financial
assets and there are no published trading prices of the three securities companies. However, the
Board of Directors assesses that the fair value of these financial assets is not materially different
from the carrying value.
