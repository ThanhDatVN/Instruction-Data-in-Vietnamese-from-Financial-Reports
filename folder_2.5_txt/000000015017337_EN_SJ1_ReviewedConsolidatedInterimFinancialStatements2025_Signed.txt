Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim consolidated financial statements based on
the results our review. We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review
Engagements No. 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the entity’s

A review of the interim financial information includes making interviews, primarily with persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and performing analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially narrower in scope than an audit performed in accordance with
Vietnamese Auditing Standards and consequently does not allow us to obtain assurance that we will
be aware of all material matters may be discovered during an audit. Accordingly, We do not express
an audit opinion.
