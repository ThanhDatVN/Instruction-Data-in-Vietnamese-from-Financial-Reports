IV. ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED
1. Basis for preparing consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting (except for
information relating to cash flows).
Affiliated units form their own accounting apparatus and perform dependent accounting. The
consolidated financial statements of the entire Company are prepared based on the consolidation of
the financial statements of affiliates . Revenue and balances between affiliates are eliminated when
preparing the consolidated financial statements.
2. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand, demand deposits, monetary gold used for value storage purposes,
excluding gold classified as inventories used as raw materials for the production of products or goods
for sale. \
Cash equivalents are short-term investments with a maturity of no more than three months from the
date of purchase, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value.
3. Types of exchange rates applied in accounting and principles of accounting for exchange rate
differences
The company has transactions in foreign currencies: USD.
Exchange rate differences arising during the period and exchange rate differences due to revaluation
of foreign currency items at the end of the period are recorded in income or expenses during the
period. Exchange rate differences due to revaluation of foreign currency balances at the end of the
period are implemented according to the guidance of Circular 200/2014/TT-BTC dated December
22, 2014 ofthe Ministry of Finance.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
Balances of foreign currency items at the end of the period are translated at the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date.
Exchange rate differences arising during the period from foreign currency transactions of foreign
currency items and exchange rate differences due to revaluation of foreign currency items at the end
of the period after offsetting the increase and decrease are recorded in financial income or financial
expenses.
Particularly in the construction investment phase to form fixed assets before the Company enters
into production and business activities (pre-operation phase), the exchange rate difference arising
when paying for foreign currency items to carry out construction investment and the exchange rate
difference arising when re-evaluating foreign currency items at the end of the accounting period are
reflected cumulatively on the Balance Sheet (index Exchange rate difference). This exchange rate
difference is gradually allocated to financial revenue or financial expenses within a period of no
more than 5 years from the date the project is put into operation.
The exchange rate used to convert transactions in foreign currencies is the actual exchange rate at
the time of the transaction of the commercial bank where the Company transacts. The exchange rate
used to re-evaluate the balance of foreign currency items at the end of the period is the buying rate
of the commercial bank or the average buying rate of the commercial banks where the Company
opens an account announced at the end of the accounting period.

Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
4. Principles of accounting for financial investments
Held to maturity investments
Investments are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the intention and ability to
hold them until maturity. Held-to-maturity investments include: term deposits (including treasury
bills and promissory notes), bonds, preference shares that the issuer must redeem at a certain time in
the future, and loans held to maturity for the purpose of earning periodic interest and other held-to-
maturity investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price and
any costs associated with the transaction. After initial recognition, these investments are recognized
at their recoverable amount. Interest income from investments held to maturity after the acquisition
date is recognized in the Income Statement on an accrual basis. Interest earned before the Company
holds the investment is deducted from the cost at the acquisition date.
When there is strong evidence that part or all of an investment may not be recovered and the amount
of loss can be reliably determined, the loss is recorded in financial expenses in the year and the
investment value is directly deducted.
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
Subsidiary
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Company has the
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee so as to obtain benefits from its
activities.
Joint venture company
A joint venture is a company established on the basis of a contractual agreement under which the
Company and the participating parties carry out economic activities on the basis of joint control.
Joint control is understood as making strategic decisions related to the operating and financial
policies of the joint venture company must have the consensus of the parties participating in the joint
venture.
Affiliated companies
An associate is an entity in which the Company has significant influence but not control over the
financial and operating policies. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and
operating policy decisions of the investee but not control over those policies.
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are initially recorded at cost, including the
purchase price or capital contribution plus costs directly related to the investment. In case of
investment in non-monetary assets, the cost of the investment is recorded at the fair value of the non­
monetary assets at the time of acquisition.
Dividends and profits from periods prior to the investment being purchased are recorded as a
reduction in the value of the investment itself. Dividends and profits from periods subsequent to the
investment being purchased are recorded as revenue. Dividends received in shares are only tracked
by the number of shares increased, not the value of the shares received/recorded at par value.
Provision for losses on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates is made when the
subsidiary joint venture or associate suffers a loss, with the provision equal to the difference between
the actual capital contributions of the parties in the subsidiary, joint venture or associate and the
actual equity multiplied by the Company's capital contribution ratio compared to the total actual
capital contributions of the parties in the subsidiaryjoint venture or associate. If the subsidiaryjoint
venture or associate is the subject of the Consolidated Financial Statement, the basis for determining
the provision for losses is the Consolidated Financial Statement.

INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Increase or decrease in the provision for investment losses in subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates that must be set up at the end of the fiscal year is recorded in financial expenses.
5. Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recorded as incurred. Receivables are stated at carrying amount less
allowance for doubtful debts.
The classification of receivables as trade receivables, internal receivables and other receivables is
carried out according to the following principles :
• Trade receivables reflect commercial receivables arising from purchase-sale transactions c
between the Company and buyers who are independent entities of the Company , including
receivables for export sales entrusted to other entities.
• Internal receivables reflect receivables from affiliated units without legal entity status that are
dependent on accounting.
• Other receivables reflect non-commercial receivables not related to purchase and sale
transactions.
Provision for doubtful debts is made for each doubtful debt based on the age of overdue debts or the
expected level of loss that may occur, specifically as follows:
• For overdue receivables:
- 30% of price treat opposite to with section in debt Right collect too limit from 6 months arrive
under 1 year
- 50% price treat opposite to with section in debt Right collect too limit from 1 year arrive under
2 years
- 70% of price treat opposite to with section in debt Right collect too limit from 2 years arrive
under 3 years
- 100% price treat opposite to with section in debt Right collect from 3 years return go up .
For receivables that are not overdue but are unlikely to be recovered: establish provisions based on
expected loss level.
6. Principles of inventory recognition
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
The cost of inventories is determined as follows:
• Raw materials, goods: include purchase costs and other directly relevant costs incurred in
bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
• Finished goods: includes the cost of raw materials, direct labor and related manufacturing
overheads allocated based on normal levels of activity.
• Work in progress costs: only include costs of main raw materials, labor costs, depreciation costs
of assets used for production activities and general production costs related to production
activities.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventories in the ordinary course of business,
less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Inventories are valued using the weighted average method and accounted for using the perpetual
inventory method.

INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
6 months head for the fiscal year ending December 31 , 2025
Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
Provision for inventory devaluation is established for each inventory item whose original cost is
greater than its net realizable value. For unfinished services, provision for devaluation is calculated
for each type of service with a separate price. Increases and decreases in the balance of provision for
devaluation of inventory required to be established at the end of the fiscal year are recorded in cost
of goods sold.
7. Principles of recording and depreciating fixed assets
a) Principles of recognition and depreciation of tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of tangible fixed
assets includes all costs incurred by the Company to acquire tangible fixed assets up to the date when tot
the asset is ready for use. Expenditures incurred after initial recognition are only recorded as an
increase in the cost of tangible fixed assets if it is certain that these costs will increase future \P
economic benefits from the use of the asset. Expenditures that do not satisfy the above conditions
are recorded immediately as expenses.
When tangible fixed assets are sold or disposed of, their cost and accumulated depreciation are
eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is included in income
or expenses for the year.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
The depreciation years for various types of Tangible Fixed Assets are as follows:
Type of fixed asset No. 5
Houses, buildings 10-25
Machinery and equipment 06-10
Means of transport, transmission 06 -08
Management equipment and tools 03 -05
Other fixed assets 0 5
8. Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of intangible fixed assets includes all costs incurred by the Company to acquire the fixed
assets up to the time the asset is ready for use. Expenses related to intangible fixed assets incurred
after initial recognition are recognized as production and business expenses in the period, unless
these expenses are associated with a specific intangible fixed asset and increase the economic
benefits from these assets.
When intangible fixed assets are sold or disposed of, their cost and accumulated depreciation are
eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is recognized as
income or expense in the year.
The Company's intangible fixed assets include:
Software program
Costs relating to computer software programs that are not an integral part of the related hardware are
capitalized. The cost of computer software is the total cost incurred by the Company up to the date
the software is put into use. Computer software is amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 years.

Expense pay before take note Recognize actual costs that have arisen but are related to the business
performance of many accounting periods and transfer these costs to the business performance of the
following accounting periods.
Tools, instruments
Tools and equipment put into use are allocated to expenses using the straight-line method with an
allocation period of no more than 03 years.
Major repair costs =
Factory repair costs are allocated to expenses using the straight-line method with an allocation period
of no more than 03 years.
10. Principles of accounting for liabilities
Payables are tracked in detail by payment term, payable entity, original currency and other factors qç
according to the management needs of the enterprise.
Payables that meet the definition of foreign currency monetary items are revalued at the end of the
period when preparing the Financial Statements.
11. Cost of unfinished construction
Construction in progress reflects costs directly related (including related interest expenses in
accordance with the Company's accounting policies ) to assets under construction and machinery
and equipment under installation, for production , rental and management purposes as well as costs
related to ongoing repairs of fixed assets. These assets are recorded at original cost and are not
depreciated.
12. Principles of recording loans and financial lease liabilities
The company must monitor in detail the payment terms of loans and financial leases. For Ioans with
a repayment period of more than 12 months from the date of the financial statements, accountants
present them as long-term loans and financial leases. For loans due within the next 12 months from
the date of the financial statements, accountants present them as short-term loans and financial leases
to have a payment plan.
For finance lease liabilities, the total lease liability reflected on the credit side of account 341 is the
total amount payable calculated by the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value
of the leased asset.
Loans and debts in foreign currency must be converted into accounting currency at the actual
transaction exchange rate at the time of occurrence;
- When paying debts or borrowing in foreign currency, the Debit side of account 341 is converted
according to the actual accounting exchange rate for each subject;
- When preparing the Financial Statements, the balance of loans and financial leases in foreign
currencies must be re-evaluated at the actual transaction exchange rate at the time of preparing the
Financial Statements.
- Exchange rate differences arising from the payment and end-of-period revaluation of loans and
financial leases in foreign currencies are recorded in financial revenue or expenses.
13. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses
Liabilities and accruals are recognized for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services
received. Accruals are recognized based on reasonable estimates of the amounts to be paid.

Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The classification of payables as trade payables, accrued expenses, internal payables and other

services, assets and the seller is an independent entity of the Company , including payables when
importing through consignees.
• Payable expenses reflect amounts payable for goods and services received from sellers or
provided to buyers but not yet paid due to lack of invoices or insufficient accounting records and
documents, and amounts payable to employees for leave wages, production and business
expenses that must be accrued in advance.

AI
Other payables reflect non-commercial payables not related to the purchase, sale or provision of Ah
goods and services. IV
ri
14. Provisions for payables
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.
If the effect of the passage of time is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected
future cash outflows required to settle the obligation at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase
in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance expense.
The Company's payable provisions include:
Product and goods warranty reserve
Provision for product and goods warranty costs is established for each type of product and goods
with warranty commitment.
product and goods warranties is from 0.5% - 1% on the revenue of products and goods. This rate is
estimated based on data on warranty costs in previous years and the weighted ratio of all possible
consequences with corresponding probabilities. Increases and decreases in the provision for product
and goods warranties that need to be set up at the end of the fiscal year are recorded in sales expenses
Coiistriiction warranty reserve
Construction warranty reserve is established for each construction project with warranty
commitment.
The warranty provision is equal to 5% of the revenue from construction works requiring warranty.
This rate is estimated based on data on warranty costs in previous years and the weighted ratio of all
possible consequences with corresponding probabilities. When the warranty period expires, the
unused or unused construction warranty provision is recorded in other income.

the Company's shareholders' meeting resolution as well as legal regulations.
The distribution of profits to shareholders takes into account non-cash items included in retained
earnings that may affect cash flows and the ability to pay dividends, such as: Gains from revaluation
of assets contributed as capital, gains from revaluation of monetary items, financial instruments and
other non-monetary items.
Dividends are recognized as liabilities when approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
17. Principles and methods of revenue recognition
Revenue from sales of goods and finished products

conditions are simultaneously satisfied:
- The enterprise has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products or
goods to the buyer.
18NAGAKAWA GROUP CORPORATION
Address : Organization people Xuan Thuong 1 Street, Phuc Yen Ward , Province Rich Tho , Vietnam
INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
6 months head for the fiscal year ending December 31 , 2025
Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
- The enterprise no longer holds the right to manage the goods as the owner of the goods or the right
to control the goods.
- Revenue is determined with relative certainty. When a contract stipulates that the buyer has the
right to return the purchased products or goods under specific conditions, revenue is only recognized
when those specific conditions no longer exist and the buyer is not entitled to return the products or
goods (except in cases where the customer has the right to return the goods in exchange for other
goods or services).
- The enterprise has obtained or will obtain economic benefits from the sale transaction.
Identify the costs associated with a sales transaction.
Service revenue
Revenue from a service transaction is recognised when the outcome of the transaction can be
measured reliably. In cases where the service is performed over several periods, revenue is
recognised in each period based on the results of the work completed at the end of the accounting
period. The outcome of a service transaction is recognised when all of the following conditions are
met:
- Revenue is measured reliably. When a contract provides that the buyer has the right to return the
services purchased under specific conditions, revenue is recognized only when the specific
conditions no longer exist and the buyer has no right to return the services provided.
- It is possible to obtain economic benefits from the transaction of providing that service.
- Determine the portion of work completed as of the end of the fiscal year.
- Identify the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction to provide
that service.
Interest
- Interest is recognized on an accrual basis, determined on the deposit account balance and the actual
interest rate for each period.
18. Accounting principles for revenue deductions
Sales deductions include: Trade discounts, sales allowances and sales returns.
Trade discounts, sales discounts, and sales returns arising in the same period of product, goods, and
service consumption are adjusted to reduce revenue of the period;
In case products, goods and services have been consumed in previous periods, and trade discounts,
sales discounts or returned goods arise in the following period, the enterprise is allowed to record a
reduction in revenue according to the following principles:
+ If products, goods, and services have been consumed in previous periods, and must be discounted,
discounted, or returned in the next period but occur before the issuance of the Financial Statement,
the accountant must consider this an event that requires adjustment occurring after the date of the
Balance Sheet and record a reduction in revenue on the Financial Statement of the reporting period
(previous period).
+ In case products, goods, and services must be discounted, have trade discounts, or are returned
after the issuance of the Financial Statement, the enterprise will record a decrease in revenue for the
period in which they arise (the following period).

Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
19. Principles of accounting for cost of goods sold.
Cost of goods sold during the year is recorded in accordance with revenue generated during the
period and ensures compliance with the principle of prudence.
For direct material costs consumed in excess of normal levels, labor costs, and fixed general
manufacturing costs not allocated to the value of products in stock, accountants must immediately
calculate them into the cost of goods sold (after deducting compensation, if any), even when the
products and goods have not been determined to be consumed. /<
The provision for inventory price reduction is included in the cost of goods sold based on the quantity j * i
of inventory and the difference between the net realizable value being less than the original cost of
inventory. When determining the volume of inventory with price reduction requiring provision, the
accountant must exclude the volume of inventory for which a sales contract has been signed (with a
net realizable value not lower than the book value) but has not been transferred to the customer if

6 months head for the fiscal year ending December 31 , 2025
Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
A, Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a party to a contract is unable to fulfill its obligations, resulting in a
financial loss to the Company.
T'
The Company is exposed to credit risks primarily from its trade receivables, bank deposits and loans. A
À
Accounts receivable ^
The company minimizes credit risk by only dealing with financially sound entities, requiring letters
of credit or collateral for first-time entities or entities with no known financial capacity. In addition,
accounts receivable staff regularly monitor receivables to urge collection.
The Company's trade receivables are related to many entities and individuals, so the concentration
of credit risk for trade receivables is low.
Bank deposit
The Company's term and non-term bank deposits are held in well-known banks in Vietnam, so the
credit risk for bank deposits is low.
Loans
The Company lends money to its subsidiaries and key management members. These entities and
individuals are all reputable and have good payment capacity, so the credit risk for the loans is low.
B, Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will have difficulty meeting its financial obligations due
to lack of funds.
The Company's liquidity risk arises mainly from the fact that its financial assets and financial
liabilities have different maturities.
The Company manages liquidity risk through the following measures: regularly monitoring current
and expected future payment requirements to maintain an appropriate amount of cash and loans,
monitoring actual and expected cash flows to minimize the impact of fluctuations in cash flows,
(presentation of liquidity risk management policy)
The maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities (excluding interest payable) based on contractual
maturity and undiscounted are as follows:

Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
The Board of Directors considers that the risk of default is low. The Company is able to meet its
debt obligations as they fall due from cash flows from operations and proceeds from maturing
financial assets. The Company has access to sufficient sources of funding and loans maturing within
12 months can be rolled over with existing lenders.
C, Market risk I
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market prices. V
Market risks related to the Company's operations include: foreign currency risk, interest rate risk,
stock price risk and commodity/raw material price risk.

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is included at the amount at which they
could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties.
The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of its financial
assets and financial liabilities:
• The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans, other receivables, borrowings,
trade payables and other short-term payables is equivalent to the book value (net of provisions for
estimated uncollectibility) of these items due to their short maturity.
• The fair value of held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets listed on the

long-term payables, held-to-maturity investments that are not listed on the stock market and do not

assets and there are no published trading prices of the three securities companies. However, the
Board of Directors assesses that the fair value of these financial assets is not materially different
from the carrying value.
