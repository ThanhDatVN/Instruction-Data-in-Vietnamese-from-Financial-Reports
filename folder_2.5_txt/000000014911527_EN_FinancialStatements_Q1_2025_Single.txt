17. Corporate income tax
Corporate income tax includes current income tax and deferred income tax.

differences between book values of assets and liabilities serving the preparation of the Financial /
Statements and the values for tax purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all the i
temporary taxable differences. Deferred income tax assets are recorded only when there is an assurance ^
on the availability of taxable income in the future against which the temporarily deductible differences can
be used.
Carrying values of deferred corporate income tax assets are considered as of the balance sheet date and
will be reduced to the rate that ensures enough taxable income against which the benefits from part of or
all of the deferred income tax can be used. Deferred corporate income tax assets, which have not been
recorded before, are considered as of the balance sheet date and are recorded when there is certainly
enough taxable income to use these unrecognized deferred corporate income tax assets.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are determined at the estimated rate to be
applied in the year when the assets are recovered or the liabilities are settled based on the effective tax
rates as of the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is recognized in the Income Statement. In the
case that deferred income tax is related to the items of the owner's equity, corporate income tax will be
included in the owner’s equity.

• The Company has the legal right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax
liabilities: and
• Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are relevant to corporate income tax
which is under the management of one tax authority either:
Of the same subject to corporate income tax; or

paid or recovered.

3. Going-concern assumption
As of 31 March 2025, the Company's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by an amount of VND
260.733.552.099 (as of 01 January 2025: VND 253.884.406.516). This factor may affect the Company’s
ability to continue as a going-concern. However, through the extension of some due long-term loans, the
receipt of dividends and the disbursement of new loans from member companies, the Company is able to
generate sufficient cash flows to finance its normal business operations in the near future. The Board of
Management assessed that it is appropriate to prepare the Interim Separate Financial Statements for the
first 3 months of the fiscal year ending 31 December 2025 on the going-concern assumption.
4. Subsequent events
Apart from the events presented in Note No. V.18b, there are no other material subsequent events which
are required adjustments or disclosures in the Interim Separate Financial Statements.
