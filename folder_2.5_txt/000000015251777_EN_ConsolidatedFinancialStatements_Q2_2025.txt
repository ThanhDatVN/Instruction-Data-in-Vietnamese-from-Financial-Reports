TV. ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED
1. Basis for preparing Consolidated Financial Statements
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting (except for
information relating to cash flows).
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of EUROPE VIETNAM
International Fertilizer Joint Stock Company (parent company) and its subsidiaries. A subsidiary
is an entity controlled by the parent company. Control exists when the parent company has the
power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of a subsidiary so as
to obtain benefits from its activities. When assessing control, potential voting rights that are
currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The results of operations of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are presented in the
Consolidated Statement of Income from the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale of the
investment in that subsidiary.
In case the accounting policy of a subsidiary is different from the accounting policy applied
consistently in the Company, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the subsidiary will be
appropriately adjusted before being used for preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Balances of accounts on the Balance Sheet between companies in the same Group, intra-group
transactions, unrealized intra-group profits arising from these transactions are eliminated when
preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealized losses arising from intra-group
transactions are also eliminated unless the costs creating such losses are unrecoverable.
Minority interests represent the portion of the profits and net assets of a subsidiary not held by
the parent company's shareholders and are presented separately in the consolidated income
statement and consolidated balance sheet. Minority interests consist of the amount of the
minority interests at the date of the original business combination and the minority interest in
changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses The minority interest in excess of its
interest in the subsidiary's equity is deducted from the Group's interest unless the minority has a
binding obligation and is able to make good the loss.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)
2. Business combination
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of a business
combination is the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or
assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group, in exchange for control of the acquired
business and, in addition, any costs directly attributable to the combination. Identifiable assets
acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at
their fair values at the date of the combination.
The difference between the cost of a business combination and the Company's share of the fair
value of the acquired party's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised at
the acquisition date is recognised as goodwill. If the cost of a business combination is less than
the fair value of the acquired party's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
recognised, the difference is recognised in the income statement in the period in which the
acquisition occurs.
The fair value of the net assets of the Subsidiary at the acquisition date is determined at book
value.
3. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash in hand and demand bank deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term investments with a recovery or maturity of no more than 3
months from the date of purchase, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value .
4. Financial investments
Held to maturity investments
Investments are classified as held-to-maturity when the company has the intention and ability to
hold them until maturity. Held-to-maturity investments include: term deposits (including
treasury bills and promissory notes), bonds, preference shares that the issuer must redeem at a
certain time in the future, loans held to maturity for the purpose of earning periodic interest and
other held-to-maturity investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price
and any costs associated with the transaction. After initial recognition, these investments are
recognized at their recoverable amount. Interest income from investments held to maturity after
the acquisition date is recognized in the Income Statement on an accrual basis. Interest earned
before the holding date is deducted from the costat the acquisition date.
When there is strong evidence that part or all of the investment may not be recovered and the
amount of loss can be reliably determined, the loss is recorded in financial expenses, during the
year and directly deduct the investment value.
5. Trade and other receivables
Accounts receivable are stated at carrying amount less allowance for doubtfill debts.
The classification of receivables as trade receivables and other receivables is carried out
according to the following principles :
• Trade receivables reflect commercial receivables arising from purchase-sale transactions
between the company and buyers who are independent entities from the Corporation ,
including receivables from export sales entrusted to other entities.
• Other receivables reflect non-commercial receivables not related to purchase and sale
transactions.

When tangible fixed assets are sold or disposed of, their cost and accumulated depreciation are
eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is recognized as
income or expense in the year.

ownership of the asset remain with the lessee. Leased fixed assets are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. The cost of leased fixed assets is the lower of the fair value of the
leased asset at the inception of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments is the
interest rate implicit in the lease or the interest rate stated in the lease. In cases where the interest
rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined, the borrowing rate at the inception of the lease is
used.
Leased fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives. In cases where it is not certain that the Company will obtain ownership of the asset at the
end of the lease term, the fixed assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the
estimated useful life. The depreciation years for different types of leased fixed assets are as

expenses, unless these expenses are likely to make the investment real estate generate more
economic benefits in the future than the initially assessed level of performance, then they are
recorded as an increase in original cost.

construction phase. Transfers from investment property to owner-occupied property or
inventories occur only when the owner starts using the property or develops it with a view to
selling it. Transfers from investment property to owner-occupied property or inventories do not

Interest
Interest is recognized on an accrual basis, determined on the deposit account balance and the
actual interest rate for each period.
Dividends and profits distributed
Dividends and profits distributed are recorded when the company is entitled to receive dividends
or profits from capital contributions. Dividends received in shares are only tracked by the
number of shares increased, not the value of shares received/recorded at par value.
17. Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold during the year is recorded in accordance with revenue generated during the
period and ensures compliance with the principle of prudence.
For direct material costs consumed in excess of normal levels, labor costs, and fixed general
manufacturing costs not allocated to the value of products in stock, accountants must
immediately calculate them into the cost of goods sold (after deducting compensation, if any),
even when the products and goods have not been determined to be consumed.
N E
18. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs include interest and other costs incurred in connection with borrowing.
Borrowing costs are recognized as expenses when incurred. Where borrowing costs are directly
related to the construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial period of time (over
12 months) to get ready for its intended use or sale, these borrowing costs are capitalized. For
loans specifically used to build fixed assets or investment properties, interest is capitalized even
if the construction period is less than 12 months. Income from temporary investment of loans is
recorded as a reduction in the original cost of the related assets.
For general borrowings used for the purpose of investing in construction or production of
unfinished assets, the capitalized borrowing costs are determined according to the capitalization
rate for the weighted average cumulative costs incurred for the investment in basic construction
or production of that asset. The capitalization rate is calculated according to the weighted
average interest rate of the outstanding loans during the year, except for separate loans serving
the purpose of forming a specific asset.
19. Selling and administrative expenses
Selling expenses reflect actual costs incurred in the process of selling products, goods, and
providing services, including costs of offering, introducing products, advertising products, sales
commissions, product and goods warranty costs (except construction activities), preservation,

costs for salaries of employees in the business management department (salaries, wages,
allowances, etc.); social insurance, health insurance, union fees, unemployment insurance for
business management employees; costs of office materials, labor tools, depreciation of fixed
assets used for business management; land rent, business license tax; provision for bad debts;

insurance, etc.); other cash expenses (reception, customer conferences, etc.).
20. Corporate income tax
Current income tax

accounting profit due to adjustments for temporary differences between tax and accounting,
non-deductible expenses as well as adjustments for non-taxable income and losses carried
forward.

Financial liabilities
The Company classifies financial liabilities into groups: financial liabilities recorded at fair
value through the Income Statement, financial liabilities determined at amortized cost. The
classification of financial liabilities depends on the nature and purpose of the financial liability
and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial liabilities are recorded at fair value through the Statement ofIncome.
A financial liability is classified as measured at fair value through the Statement of Income if it
is held for trading or designated as such at fair value through the Statement of Income upon
initial recognition.
Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading securities if:
• Issued or created primarily for the purpose of repurchasing in the short term;
• The Company intends to hold for the purpose of short-term profit;
• Derivative financial instruments (except for derivative financial instruments that are
identified as a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging
instrument).
o
Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost.
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, which is the amount at which the financial
liability is initially recognised minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative
amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount
and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance
account) for impairment or uncollectibility.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial
liability or group of financial liabilities and allocating interest income or expense over the
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate at which estimated future cash flows that
will be paid or received over the expected life of the financial instrument or, if appropriate,
shorter, are discounted to the net present carrying amount of the financial liability.
Initial book value of financial liability
At initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at issue price plus any costs directly
attributable to the issue of the financial liability.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company
after deducting all of its liabilities.
22. Information by department
Fertilizer production and trading activities in Hau Giang and Can Tho areas mainly generate
revenue and profit for the Company, while other revenues account for a small proportion of the
Company's total revenue. Therefore, the Board of Directors believes that the Company operates
in a single business segment, which is fertilizer trading in a geographical area. Therefore, there
is no requirement to present additional segment information.
23. Related parties
Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control the other party or
exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions.
Parties are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common
significant influence.
In considering any related party relationship, attention is directed more to the substance of the
relationship than to the legal form.
Transactions with related parties during the period are presented in note VII. 1.

borrowings, trade payables and other short-term payables is equivalent to the book value (net of
provisions for estimated uncollectibility) of these items due to their short maturity.
• The fair value of loans, trade receivables, other receivables, borrowings, trade payables and
other long-term payables, held-to-maturity investments that are not listed on the stock market
and do not have a trading price announced by 3 securities companies is estimated by discounting
cash flows at the interest rate applicable to debts with similar characteristics and remaining
maturity.
4. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a party to a contract is unable to fulfill its obligations, resulting in a
financial loss to the Company.
The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables)
and financing activities (bank deposits, loans and other financial instruments).
Accounts receivable
The Company minimizes credit risk by only dealing with financially sound entities, requiring
letters of credit to be opened for entities that are trading for the first time or have no information
on their financial capabilities, and having accounts receivable staff regularly monitor receivables
to urge collection. On this basis, and the Company's receivables are related to many different
customers, credit risk is not concentrated on a particular customer.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will have difficulty meeting its financial obligations
due to lack of funds.

Company's liquidity risk arises primarily from the mismatch of maturities between its financial
assets and financial liabilities.

equivalents and borrowings deemed adequate by the Board of Directors to meet the Company's
operational needs and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.

of fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt remaining constant.

fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
