lower selling expenses compared to the pre-audit figures.

Re: Explanation of auditor's
Hanoi, June 29th, 2025,
exception opinion in 2024
financial statements
To: - State Securities Commission
Hanoi Stock Exchange
First of all, HIPT Group Joint Stock Company would like to send the most respectfill greetings
to the State Securities Commission and Hanoi Stock Exchange.
HIPT Group Joint Stock Company would like to explain the financial statements that were given
an exceptional opinion by the auditing organization as follows:
1. Auditor’s qualified audit opinion:
As of March 31, 2025, the Company has estimated the value of trading securities based on
the actual transaction value on the stock market. The Company has assessed the decrease in value
of trading securities based on the original amount of trading securities and has not taken into
account the amount of dividends received in shares owned as of March 31, 2025 according to the
o
hi
guidance in Clause 1, Article 5 of Circular No. 48/2019/TT-BTC Guiding the provision andffo
u
handling of provisions for inventory price reduction, investment losses, bad debts and product,
SINCE
goods, services and construction works warranties at enterprises. The Company's documents show
that if reflected according to the total number of original shares and dividends received in shares,
the item "Provision for decrease in value of trading securities" on the Balance Sheet will decrease
by VND 14,252,609,300. At the same time, on the Business Performance Report, the "Financial
Expenses" item will decrease by VND 14,252,609,300, the "Current Corporate Income Tax
Expenses" item will increase by VND 2,850,521,860 and the "Profit after tax" item will increase
by VND 11,402,087,440.
As of the date of this report, we have not been able to obtain the contract and related
documents of the short-term loan to Agri-Vina Group Joint Stock Company with a value of VND
33 billion. Additional audit procedures also do not allow us to verify the correctness of the above
receivable balance. Therefore, we are unable to determine the necessary adjustments to the above
receivable balance as at December 31, 2024 as well as its impact on the indicators on the Balance
Sheet, Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement for 2024.
The financial statements for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2025 of the subsidiary, HIPT
Joint Stock Company, have not been audited. Due to the limitation in the scope of the audit, we are
unable to determine the existence and existence of the total asset value of VND 138,115,267,241
of this subsidiary as at 31 March 2025 when consolidated in the Consolidated Financial Statementsand are also unable to determine whether it is necessary to adjust the difference affecting the
Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 March 2025.
2. Explanation of the company;
Regarding the provision for trading securities: There is currently a difference of opinion
between the auditor and the Company. Specifically, the Company only records the quantity of
shares in its accounting books and recognizes the value of shares issued from dividends at 0 VND
in accordance with Article 15 of Circular 200/2014/TT-BTC. Therefore, when making provisions,
the Company does not include the quantity of these shares. In contrast, the auditor calculates the
provision based on the average price applied to the entire quantity of shares, resulting in a lower
provision amount compared to the Company’s figures. This is the main reason for the discrepancy
between the auditor’s data and the Company’s report.
Regarding the Agrivina’s loan: The auditor has performed audit procedures through sending
confirmation letters and has received confirmation that the loan balance is correct. However, due
to the long duration, complexity, and extensions of this loan, the auditor has expressed caution in
assessing this receivable.
Regarding the financial statements of the subsidiary: The Company has presented the figures
fairly and reasonably. At the same time, the subsidiary is not subject to mandatory audit for the
year 2024 in accordance with Article 4 of Decree No. 90/2025/ND-CP.
The Company is committed to continuing to cooperate closely with the auditor to providing
all necessary documents and evidence in order to improve the transparency of its fmanci
statements. At the same time, the Company will consider making appropriate adjustments in the
next accounting period to ensure that the financial statements present a true and fair view of
Company’s financial position.
Through this official letter, the Company respectfully requests the State Securities
Commission of Vietnam and the Hanoi Stock Exchange to review and approve the explanati
provided herein. The Company commits to taking full legal responsibility for the truthfulness and
accuracy of the above-mentioned content.
Sincerely thank you!

conducted our audit in accordance with the Vietnamese Auditing Standards. Those standards require
us to comply with ethical requirements, plan and perform the audit to achieve reasonable assurance
about whether the Financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the figures and notes in the
Financial statements. The selection of procedures depends on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the material misstatement risks due to fraud or error of the Financial statements. In
making those risk assessments, the auditors examined internal control relating to the true and fair
preparation and presentation of the Financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in circumstances, but not to express opinions on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control. The audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of applicable accounting
policies and the reasonableness of accounting estimates of the Board of General Management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our qualified audit opinion.

Bao Viet Commercial Joint Stock Bank. However, as of March 31, 2025, the procedures related to the

i. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due
to changes in market prices. There are four types of market risk: interest rate risk, currency risk,
commodity price risk, and equity price risk.
Interest rate risk

fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. The Company's market risk due to changes in
interest rates mainly relates to the Company's cash, short-term deposits and loans.
The Company manages interest rate risk by analyzing the competitive situation in the market to
obtain an interest rate that is favorable for the Company's purposes and remains within its risk
management limits.
Commodity price risk
The company purchases raw materials and goods from domestic suppliers to serve production and
business activities. Therefore, the Company will bear the risk from changes in the selling price of raw
materials and goods. This risk will be managed by the Company by purchasing from a large number
=of different suppliers, as well as being flexible in negotiations
ii. Credit risk ^
Credit risk is the risk that a party to a financial instrument or transaction contract will fail to perform its
obligations, resulting in financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its business
activities (primarily with respect to accounts receivable from customers), and from its financial
activities, including deposits with banks, foreign exchange transactions and other financial
/ i instruments.

lack of capital. The company's liquidity risk arises mainly from the fact that its financial assets and
financial liabilities have different maturities.
The Company minimizes liquidity risk by maintaining a level of cash and cash equivalents and loans
that the Board of Management considers sufficient to support the Company's operations and minimize
risks, risk due to fluctuations in cash flows.
