SAOBACDAU TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION
Report on the consolidated financial statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of SaoBacDau Technologies
Corporation and its subsidiaries prepared on 25 June 2025 as set out from page 05 to page 43, which comprise
the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2025, and the consolidated income statement,
and consolidated cash flow statement for the financial year then ended, and the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.
Board of Directors' Responsibility
Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards and Vietnamese Corporate Accounting
System and relevant legislation as to the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements
and for such internal control as Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation and
presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.
Auditors' Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by Board of Directors, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit qualified opinion.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT (CONTINUED)
Masis for Qualified Opinion
As at the date of issuing the independent auditor’s report, we had not obtained sufficient confirmation for tt^
non-current trade receivables as at 31 March 2025 amounting to VND 19.16 billion. With the Group’s existing
documentation, we were also unable to perform alternative procedures to verify the non-current trade;
receivables as at 31 March 2025 and their possible effects on the financial statements. As a result, we were?
unable to determine whether any adjustments to these balances were necessary.

In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the matter described in the "Basis for Qualified Opinion"
paragraph, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated
financial position of SaoBacDau Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2025, and of

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
2.5. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are the financial statements of a group in which the assets,
liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent and subsidiaries are presented as
those of a single economic entity regardless of the legal structure of the entities. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries have been prepared for the same financial year using uniform ^
accounting policies to those used by the parent company.
A subsidiary is fully consolidated from the acquisition date on which the Group obtains control over the
subsidiary until the date on which the parent ceases to control the subsidiary, unless control is intended 7A'
to be temporary because the subsidiary is acquired and held exclusively with the intention of selling or »^
disposing of it within twelve months.
Non-controlling interest recognition
Non-controlling interests in the net assets and net results of consolidated subsidiaries are shown
separately in the consolidated statement of financial position and in the consolidated income
statement.
The loss of a subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative
interests in the subsidiary even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Intra-group transactions elimination
All intra-group transactions, balances, income, and expenses - including unrealised intra-group profits
or losses - are eliminated in full on consolidation. Unrealised losses resulting from intra-group
transactions that are deducted in arriving at the carrying amount of assets are also eliminated unless
the cost cannot be recovered. ,
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ?
3.1. Foreign currencies
■ The exchange rates applied in accounting is the actual exchange rate when the transaction
incurred;
■ The exchange rate applicable to asset recognition and re-evaluation is the foreign currency-buying
rate;
■ The exchange rate applicable to liability recognition and re-evaluation the foreign currency-selling
rate;
■ Exchange rates applicable to the other transactions are the foreign currency-buying rate/ the
foreign currency-selling rate.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded, on initial recognition, in the reporting currency, by
applying to the foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the reporting currency and
the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. The exchange differences arising on the settlement
of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. At the end of the
reporting year, monetary items excluding advances to suppliers, prepaid expenses, and unearned
revenues, which are denominated in foreign currency, are reported using the closing rate and resultant
exchange differences resulting from the reporting after offset are recognised in profit or loss in the year
in which they arise.
3.2. Use of estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires Board of Directors to make estimates
and assumptions that impact the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, contingent assets and
liabilities reported in the notes at 31 March 2025 as well as revenues and expenses in the consolidated
financial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2025. Although these estimates are based
on Board of Directors’ best knowledge of all relevant information available at the date when the
consolidated financial statements are prepared, this does not prevent actual figures differing from
estimates.

Investments are classified as investments in associates when the Group directly or indirectly holds
from 20% to under 50% of the voting shares of the investee without any other agreement.
Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, on
initial recognition the investment in an associate is recognised at cost. In case of investments of non­
monetary assets, the cost of investments is recognised at the fair values of the assets as incurred.
The carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the Group’s share of profit or loss of the
associate after the date of acquisition.
Distributions received from associates reduce the carrying amount of the investment.
Other investments
Investments classified as other investments are investments other than investments in subsidiaries,
investments in joint ventures or investments on associates.
Other investments are accounted for under the cost method which comprise purchase prices plus (+)
acquisition related costs (if any). In case of investments of non-monetary assets, the cost of
investments is recognised at the fair values of the assets as incurred.
Recognition principles of provision for other financial investment impairment loss
For other investments
Provisions for impairment losses on equity investments in other entities are determined using fair
values if the fair values can measure reliably. If the fair values cannot be measure reliably at the
reporting date, provisions are measured on the basis of the investee's losses.
3.5. Account receivables
Recognition method
1.1
Account receivables are stated at the carrying amounts of trade receivables and other receivables
less provisions for doubtful debts.
IJ
Provision for doubtful debts

overheads.
The costs of purchase comprise the purchase price, non-reimbursable taxes and duties, and transport,
handling, and other costs directly attributable to the purchase. Trade discounts and sales rebates on
substandard and obsolete goods purchased are deducted from the costs of purchase.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated
costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Method of accounting for inventories
Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method and are recorded under the perpetual
inventory method.
Provision for decline in value of inventories
As of the date of the consolidated financial statements, provisions are recognised for obsolete, slow-
moving, defective inventory, and for inventory stated at cost higher than net realisable value.
The difference between the required balance and the existing balance of the provision for a decline in
value of inventories is included in cost of sales in the income statement.
Inventories are written down to net realizable value item by item. For services being rendered,
provision is made in respect of each service for which a separate selling price is charged.

and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. i
Financial leases
Finance leases are recognised as assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position at amounts
equal to the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term at a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis
as owned assets. Estimated depreciation period for machinery is from 2 to 3 years.
Operating leases
Lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
3.10. Leases
! I
Operating leases

as incurred or amortised over the lease term. Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the
consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term regardless of payment
methods.
Depreciation of assets subject to operating leases is consistent with the depreciation policy of the
lessor for similar assets.

payables represent those arising from purchase and sale related transactions of goods, services or
assets and the seller is independent of the buyer; the remaining payables are classified as other
payables.

consolidated financial statements, original currency, and each creditor.
Liabilities are recognised at no less than the payment obligation.

3.17. Taxation
Corporate income tax
Current corporate income tax expense
Current corporate income tax expense is determined on the basis of taxable income and the rate of
corporate income tax (CIT) of the current year at 20%.
Deferred corporate income tax expense
Deferred corporate income tax expense is determined on the basis of the deductible temporary
differences, taxable temporary differences and the estimated CIT rate that will be applied for the years
that assets and liabilities will be recovered. The tax rates used will be the tax rates (and tax laws) that
are in effect at the financial year end.
Deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences, unless:
■ The deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction
which at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax
loss);
■ All taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and
associates, and interests in joint ventures when the parent, investor or venturer is able to control
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be
utilised, unless: ji
P
■ The deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction ;
which at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss);
■ The deferred tax assets for all deductible temporary differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint ventures are only recognised when it
is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future; and taxable profit
will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset shall be reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the
benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilised. Any such reduction shall be reverted to
the extent it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.
Current and deferred tax are recognised as income or an expense and included in profit or loss for the
year except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the
same or a different year, directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are only offset if, and only if, the Group has a legally
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets
and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the
Group intends to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or to realise the assets and
settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax
liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.
