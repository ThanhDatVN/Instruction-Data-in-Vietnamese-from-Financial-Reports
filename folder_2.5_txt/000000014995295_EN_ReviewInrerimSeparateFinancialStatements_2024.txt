REPORT ON REVIEW OF
INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
To: The Shareholders, the Board of Directors and the Board of General Directors
The Golden Group Joint Stock Company
We have reviewed the accompanying interim financial statements of The Golden Group Joint
Stock Company (“the Company”), prepared on 19 May 2025, as set out from page 8 to 36, which
comprise the Interim Balance sheet as at 30 June 2024, the Interim Income statement, the Interim
Cash flow statement for the six-month period ended 30 June 2024 and the Notes to the Interim
Financial statements.
The Board of General Directors’ responsibility
The Board of General Directors of the Company is responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of these interim financial statements of the Company in accordance with the
Vietnamese Accounting Standards, Vietnamese Accounting System and comply with relevant
statutory requirements to preparation and presentation of the financial statements and for such
internal control as the Board of General Directors of the Company determines is necessary to
enable the preparation and presentation of these interim financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion these interim financial statements based on our
review. We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Review
Engagements No. 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity.
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
Vietnamese Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit Accordingly,
we do not express an audit opinion.
Basis for Qualified Conclusion
1. As of the issuance date of this Report, we have not obtained sufficient confirmation letters for
certain balances presented in the Balance Sheets as at 30 June 2024 and 31 December 2023.
Alternative audit procedures performed did not provide us with sufficient appropriate evidence to
evaluate these balances and their potential effects on other items in the interim financial
statements for the six-month period ended 30 June 2024. Specifically, these balances include the
following:

INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(continued)
Basis for Qualified Conclusion (cont.)
2. As disclosed in point (d) of section 5.2 of the Notes to the Interim Financial statements, as of June
30, 2024, we have not obtained the reviewed financial statements for the six-month period ended
30 June 2024, of Louis AMC Asset Management and Exploitation Joint Stock Company (referred
to as "Louis AMC"). Consequently, we do not have sufficient basis to assess the financial position
and the recoverability of the investment in Louis AMC, which is recorded at its original cost ofVND
88,700,000,000. Therefore, we are unable to evaluate the impact on the required provision (if any)
for this investment as of June 30, 2024, as well as to determine its effects on other related items in
the accompanying interim financial statements.
3. As disclosed in point (g) of section 5.2 of the Notes to the Interim Financial statements, as of June
30, 2024, we have not obtained the reviewed financial statements for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2024, of Investment and Construction Consulting Joint Stock Company (referred to as
"CIC") to assess the financial position and recoverability of the Company's investment in CIC,
recorded at its original cost of VND 20,654,000,000. Therefore, the Company has not considered
quantifying the impact on the carrying value of this investment in the associate, recorded at its
original costofVND 20,654,000,000.
4. As presented in section 5.13.2 of the Notes to the Interim Financial statements, the balance of
other payables to individuals related to the business cooperation contracts for the Ao Gioi - Suoi
Tien Resort Project as of 30 June 2024 was VND 3,080,000,000 (as of 31 December 2023: VND
3,080,000,000).
These business cooperation contracts did not specify the method of profit sharing, the proportion
of profit sharing, the total capital contribution, or the specific capital contribution schedule for each
party. Additionally, the remittance documents from these individuals lacked clear information about
the remitters, and in some cases, the funds were transferred by third parties with various
descriptions. As of the date of this report, the project has been revoked pursuant to a decision by
the People's Committee of Phu Tho Province.
As of October 25, 2024, the Company refunded a total amount of VND 3,080,000,000 to the
individual investors in accordance with Decision No. 65/2024/TGG/TGD-QD dated October 15,
2024, issued by the Company’s General Director regarding the refund of deposits for the "Ao Gioi -
Suoi Tien Resort Project.” The refunded amounts to each individual corresponded to the amounts
previously paid to the Company and the bank accounts of those individual.
O
In 2021, the Company transferred a portion of other payables related to the business cooperation
contracts of these individuals into the income statement, with an amount of VND 3,073,000,000.
As of the issuance date of this report, the Company and these individuals have not executed a
o
liquidation memorandum for the business cooperation contract concerning the Ao Gioi - Suoi Tien
Resort Project. □
Based on the available documents and the audit procedures performed, we cannot specifically
identify the contributing parties, the capital contributions of each party, or determine whether the
Company has refunded the amounts to these individuals and whether the rights and obligations
under the contract have been terminated. Therefore, we are unable to assess the balance of other
payables related to the aforementioned business cooperation contract or evaluate the impact of
these matters on other items in the consolidated financial statements for the six-month period
ended June 30, 2024.

NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the six-month period ended 30 June 2024
These notes form an integral part of and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements.
4.3 Financial investments
Investments in subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are controlled by the Company. The control is achieved when the Company has
the ability to control the financial and operating policies of the investee enterprise so as to
obtain economic benefits from the operation of this enterprise.
Associate Companies
An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence but does not have
control over its financial and operating policies. Significant influence is the power to participate
in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not to control those policies.
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are initially recognized at cost, including purchase
price or capital contributions plus costs directly attributable to the investments. In case of
investments in non-monetary assets, the cost of the investment is recorded at the fair value of
non-monetary assets at the time they occur.
Dividends and profits from previous periods, before investments are purchased, are accounted
for the decrease in value of such investments. Dividends and profit of the period after the
investment is acquired revenue recognition. Dividends received in shares only track the number
of shares increases, no recognition of the value of shares received.
Provisions for impairment of investments in subsidiaries and associates are made when these
entities incur losses. The provision is calculated as the difference between the actual capital
contribution of all parties in the subsidiary or associate and the actual equity, multiplied by the
Company's ownership percentage relative to the total actual capital contributions of all parties.
If the subsidiary or associate prepares consolidated financial statements, the basis for
determining the impairment provision is the consolidated financial statements.
Increases or decreases in the provision for impairment of investments in subsidiaries and
associates as of the financial year-end are recognized in financial expenses.
4.4 Receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at cost less provision for doubtful debts.
The classifications of receivables are trade receivables and other receivables, which complied
with the following principles:
Trade receivables reflect the nature of the receivables arising from commercial transactions
with purchase - sale between the Company and an independent purchaser.
Other receivables reflect the nature of the receivables arising from non-commercial
transactions, and not to be related to the purchase - sale transactions.
The provision for doubtful debts represents the estimated loss due to non-payment arising on
receivables that were outstanding at the balance sheet date. Increases and decreases to the
provision balance are recognised as general and administrative expense in the Income
statement
4.5 Prepaid expenses
Prepaid expenses are reported as short-term or long-term prepaid expenses on the balance
sheet and amortised over the period for which the amounts are paid or the period in which
economic benefits are generated in relation to these expenses.

(*) This is the amount of money provided by the People's Committee of Hoa Binh Province to the
Company for the implementation of the "Industrial Pig Farming Project" at Phuong Vien Hamlet,
Tan Thanh Township, Luong Son District, Hoa Binh Province, according to Investment
Certificate No. 25121000446 issued by the People's Committee of Hoa Binh Province on May
13, 2014, and amended for the second time on March 6, 2015. According to the Investment
Certificate, the total investment capital of the project is VND 150 billion. The project was
terminated according to Decision No. 71/QD-SKHDT dated June 7, 2021, of the Department of
Planning and Investment of Hoa Binh Province.
On December 30, 2024, the Company entered into Asset Sale Contract No.
74/2024/HDMBTS/TGG-NCB to sell all assets located on the land of the "Industrial Pig Farming
Project" in Phuong Vien Hamlet, Tan Thanh Commune, Luong Son District, Hoa Binh Province,
for a total amount of VND 2,100,000,000. As per the agreement, the buyer transferred the
entire amount directly to the Hoa Binh State Treasury with the description "Repayment to the
State Budget of Hoa Binh Province for the financial support provided for the “Industrial Pig
Farming Project” in Tan Thanh Commune, Luong Son District, Hoa Binh Province." The
transaction was completed on January 10, 2025, as per the asset handover minutes, and the
Company issued the corresponding invoice on January 20, 2025. On January 14, 2025, the
buyer completed the payment to the State Treasury, as evidenced by Payment Receipt No.
0001830 dated January 14, 2025.
The Company is recognizing income from the liquidation mentioned above under other income
for the year 2025, with no corresponding liquidation expenses incurred. This is because in
2021, the Company had fully charged the carrying amount of the pig farming project assets to
other expenses.
