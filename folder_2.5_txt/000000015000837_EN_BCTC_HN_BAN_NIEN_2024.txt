vitamin, protein, therapy and water infusion services to improve patient health, is gradually becoming a
popular trend in many countries such as Japan, the US, Thailand. However, in Vietnam, this model is
still quite new and has not been widely deployed. At the same time, after reviewing and evaluating the
overall mobile examination vehicle project, investment project, joint venture linking medical image

REPORT ON REVIEW RESULTS

First 6 months of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024

Dear ; Shareholders, Board of Directors, Management N(

American VietNamese Biotech INC
M
íĩi
We have reviewed the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements of American
VietNamese Biotech INC, prepared on 23 May 2025 from page 08 to page 45, including the interim
PH
consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2024, the interim consolidated income statement, the interim
consolidated cash flow statement for the first 6 months of the fiscal year ended 31 December 2024 and
the notes to the interim consolidated financial statements.
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors
Board of DirectorsAmerican VietNamese Biotech INCresponsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese accounting
standards, accounting regimes and legal regulations related to the preparation and presentation of
interim consolidated financial statements and responsible for internal control that the Board of Directors
determines is necessary to ensure the preparation and presentation of interim consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements based on our review.
We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review Engagements No. 2410 -
Review of interim financial information performed by the independent auditor of the entity.
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on
Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
- Some associated companies have been established but have not yet formed or have insignificant assets
serving production and business activities. The amount of capital contributed to these companies is
VND 30,950,000,000 (Note V.13). Through the applied auditing procedures, we do not have sufficient
basis to assess the reasonableness of the above investments as well as their impact on the consolidated
financial statements for the first 6 months of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.

[W] www//vpaudit.vn [E] vpa@ntva.vn 98 Vũ Tông Phan, p. An Phú, Q. 2, TP. Hó Chí MinhREPORT ON REVIEW RESULTS (CONTINUED)
- The parent company and its subsidiaries have prepaid for goods and services to the seller but have not
yet received the goods and services according to the terms of the contract. As of the date of issuance of
these financial statements, the Company has not yet received the goods or recovered the prepaid
amount of VND 419,809,600,000 (as of January 1, 2024, it was VND 399,840,000,000). We have
performed additional audit procedures but were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to
assess the recoverability of these prepayments at the above times. Therefore, we are unable to express
an opinion on the recoverability of this prepayment as of June 30, 2024 as well as the impact of this
issue on the Company's accompanying interim consolidated financial statements.
- As of June 30, 2024, Viet My Hospital Investment Joint Stock Company is implementing a
cooperation investment project for a centralized medical waste treatment area with Sara Vung Tau Joint
Stock Company with an amount of VND 61,717,000,000. At the time of issuing this report, the above
project has not yet completed the procedures to come into operation. Through auditing procedures, we
IF
cannot assess the effectiveness and recoverability of the above investment as well as their impact on the
rc
consolidated financial statements for the first 6 months of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.
ill
- The Company has invested and installed machinery, equipment, and RIS-PACS medical image
storage and transmission software systems under lease contracts and cooperation agreements with
hospitals and medical centers with an investment cost of VND 67,541,800,532 as of June 30, 2024 (of
which the value handed over to the hospital for use is VND 40,953,427,745, and the value not yet
handed over to the hospital is VND 26,588,372,787). Some hospitals have generated revenue, but due
to the lack of specific and unified instructions on payment for imaging diagnostic technical services
based on the PACS system, the Company still does not have enough reliable basis to fully determine
the economic benefits gained from the above lease and cooperation. However, the Company has
recorded depreciation expenses for the transferred assets in the business results of the years, the
accumulated depreciation value as of June 30, 2024 is VND 18,573,725,968 (of which the accumulated
value up to December 31, 2023 is VND 16,526,054,590, the depreciation for the first 6 months of 2024
is VND 2,047,671,378). By applying audit procedures, we have not determined their impact on the
consolidated financial statements for the first 6 months of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.
- As of June 30, 2024, the value of unfinished basic construction costs for purchasing machinery and
equipment for operating clinics with the amount of VND 65,777,789,540 has arisen for a long time and
has not been accepted and handed over for use. Through auditing procedures, we cannot estimate the
fair value of this basic construction cost as well as its impact on the 2024 Interim Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Qualified Opinion
Based on our review,except for the effects of the matters described in the “Basis for Qualified Audit
Opinion” paragraphWe have not come across anything that causes us to believe that the accompanying
interim consolidated financial statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the interim
consolidated financial position ofAmerican VietNamese Biotech INCas at 30 June 2024, and the
consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the first 6 months of the fiscal year
ended 31 December 2024, in accordance with Vietnamese accounting standards, accounting regimes
and legal regulations related to the preparation and presentation of consolidated interim financial
statements.
Emphasis of Matters
As of June 30, 2024, the Company's loan at BVBank is VND 29,625,095,827 and is overdue. As of the
issuance date of this report, the above Ioan is overdue. The extension request period stated in Official
Letter No. 05/2024/CV-AMV of the Company was October 2024, and it was approved by BVBank in
Official Letter No. 212/2024/BVbank/CV-QL&THN dated April 9, 2024. However, as of now, the
6REPORT ON REVIEW RESULTS (CONTINUED)
Company has not yet fully repaid the aforementioned principal amount and is continuing to work with
the Bank to request an extension. (Note V. 18a).
Other matters
- The interim consolidated financial statements for the first 6 months of the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2023 and the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31,
2023 of American VietNamese Biotech INC have been reviewed and audited by another auditing
company. The independent audit report No. 202/BCKT-TC issued on March 29, 2024 expressed an
unqualified opinion because the auditor could not estimate the net realizable value of the inventory of
various types of software presented at original price at December 31, 2023: VND 140,080,690,416. Up
to now, the entire value of the above software has been sold, and all debts have been paid up to the time
of reporting, so our audit conclusion is no longer affected by this issue.
Y
- The advance payment to the seller is overdue and the possibility of recovery is undetermined, which is
VND 399,840,000,000. This issue continues to affect the Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for Al
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. J|[
In addition, the 2023 Audit Report highlights the following items: ^
+ American VietNamese Biotech INC invested in and installed the RIS-PACS medical image
transmission software system at hospitals and medical centers under cooperation contracts but has not
recorded revenue from this activity. This issue has been stated in our exception conclusion basis.
+ The loan at BVBank at December 31, 2023 is VND 31,623,165,292 and is overdue for payment. We
continue to emphasize this issue in the Audit Report of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the
first 6 months of the fiscal year ending December 31,2024.

IV. ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED
1. Basis for preparing Consolidated Financial Statements
Financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting (except for information relating to
cash flows).
The consolidated financial statements include the Financial Statements of American VietNamese
Biotech lNC.(parent company) and subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the
parent company. Control exists when the parent company has the power, directly or indirectly, to
govern the financial and operating policies of a subsidiary so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In
assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into
account.
The results of operations of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are presented in the
Consolidated Statement of Income from the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale of the
investment in that subsidiary.
In case the accounting policy of a subsidiary is different from the accounting policy applied
consistently in the Group, the Financial Statements of the subsidiary will be appropriately adjusted
before being used for preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Balances of accounts on the Balance Sheet between companies in the same Group, intra-group
transactions, unrealized intra-group profits arising from these transactions are eliminated when
preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealized losses arising from intra-group
transactions are also eliminated unless the costs creating such losses are unrecoverable.

INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
First 6 months of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024
Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements(next)
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of the profits and net assets of a subsidiary not held by
the parent company's shareholders and are presented separately in the consolidated income statement
and consolidated balance sheet. Minority interests consist of the amount of the minority interests at the
date of the original business combination and the minority's share of changes in equity since the date
of the combination. LossesThe minority interest in excess of its interest in the subsidiary's equity is
deducted from the Group's interest unless the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make
good the loss.
2. Business combination
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the company are measured at their fair values at the
date of acquisition. Any Totalitional difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any negative difference between the purchase price and the x
fair value of the assets acquired is recognised in the income statement for the period in which the
subsidiary is acquired.
Non-controlling interests at the date of the initial business combination are measured based on the non­
controlling interest's share of the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
recognised.
3. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand, demand deposits, monetary gold used for value storage purposes,
excluding gold classified as inventories used as raw materials for the production of products or goods
for sale.
Cash equivalents are short-term investments with a maturity of no more than three months from the
date of purchase, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value.
4. Financial investments
Loans
Loans are measured at cost less allowance for doubtful debts. Allowance for doubtful debts on loans is
made based on the expected level of loss that may occur.
Investments in joint ventures and associates
Investments in associates are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price or capital
contribution plus costs directly attributable to the investment. In the case of investments in non­
monetary assets, the cost of the investment is recognized at the fair value of the non-monetary assets at
the time of acquisition.
Dividends and profits from periods prior to the investment being purchased are recorded as a reduction
in the value of the investment itself. Dividends and profits from periods subsequent to the investment
being purchased are recorded as revenue. Dividends received in shares are only tracked by the number
of shares increased, not the value of the shares received/recorded at par value.
Provision for losses on investments in associates is made when the associate suffers a loss, with the
provision equal to the difference between the actual capital contributions of the parties in the joint
venture or associate and the actual equity multiplied by the ratio of the Enterprise's capital contribution
to the total actual capital contributions of the parties in the associate. If the associate is the subject of

INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
First 6 months of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024
Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements(next)
the Consolidated Financial Statements, the basis for determining the provision for losses is the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Increases and decreases in the provision for investment losses in associates that need to be set up at the
end of the fiscal year are recorded in financial expenses.
Investments in equity instruments of other entities
Investments in equity instruments of other entities include investments in equity instruments but the
Enterprise does not have control joint control or significant influence over the investee.
Investments in equity instruments of other entities are initially recorded at cost, including the purchase
price or capital contribution plus direct costs related to the investment. Dividends and profits from
'N
periods prior to the investment being purchased are recorded as a reduction in the value of the
investment itself. Dividends and profits from periods subsequent to the investment being purchased are
recorded as revenue. Dividends received in shares are only tracked by the number of Totalitional
shares, not recording the value of shares received/recorded at par value (except for state-owned
enterprises in accordance with current regulations of law).
Provision for losses on investments in equity instruments of other entities is made as follows:
• For investments in listed shares or for which the fair value of the investment is reliably
determined, the provision is based on the market value of the shares.
• For investments whose fair value cannot be determined at the reporting date, provisions are made
based on the loss of the investee with the provision equal to the difference between the actual
capital contribution of the parties at other entities and the actual equity multiplied by the capital
contribution ratio of the Enterprise compared to the total actual capital contribution of the parties
at other entities.
Increases and decreases in the provision for investment losses in equity instruments of other entities
that need to be set up at the end of the fiscal year are recorded in financial expenses.

In some hospitals, there has been revenue, but due to the lack of specific and unified instructions on

does not have enough reliable basis to fully determine the economic benefits that will be obtained

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is reflected at the amount at which the
financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable and willing
parties.
The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate fair value:
• The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans, other receivables, borrowings,
trade payables and other short-term payables is equivalent to the book value (net of provisions for
estimated uncollectibility) of these items due to their short maturity.
• The fair value of loans, trade receivables, other receivables, borrowings, trade payables and other
long-term payables, held-to-maturity investments that are not listed on the stock market and do not
have a trading price announced by 3 securities companies is estimated by discounting cash flows at the
interest rate applicable to debts with similar characteristics and remaining maturity.
3. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a party to a contract will not be able to perform.its obligations resulting in
financial loss to the Company.
The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and
financing activities (bank deposits, loans and other financial instruments).
Accounts receivable
The Company minimizes credit risk by only dealing with financially sound entities, requiring letters of
credit to be opened for entities that are trading for the first time or have no information on their
financial capabilities, and having accounts receivable staff regularly monitor receivables to urge
collection. On this basis, and the Company's receivables are related to many different customers, credit
risk is not concentrated on a particular customer.
