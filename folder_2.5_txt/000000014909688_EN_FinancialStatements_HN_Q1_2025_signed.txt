4. Accounting principles for investments
Held-to-maturity investments
Investments are classified as held-to-maturity investments when the Company has both the
intention and the ability to hold it until maturity. Held-to-maturity investments include term
deposits (including treasury bills and promissory notes), bonds, preferred shares that the issuer is
obligated to repurchase at a specific future date, and loans held to maturity for the purpose of
earning periodic interest, as well as other held-to-maturity investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price and any
related transaction costs. After initial recognition, these investments are recorded at their
recoverable value. Interest income from held-to-maturity investments after the purchase date is
recognized in the Income Statement on an accrual basis. Interest earned before the Company
acquires the investment is deducted from the initial cost at the time of purchase.
When there is conclusive evidence that a portion or the entire investment may not be recoverable,
and the loss can be reliably measured, the loss is recognized as a financial expense for the period
and directly deducted from the investment's value.
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are companies controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Company
has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee to derive economic
benefits from its activities.
Joint ventures
Joint ventures are companies established based on a contractual agreement in which the Company
and other participating parties undertake economic activities under joint control. Joint control
means that strategic decisions related to the joint venture’s financial and operating policies require
unanimous consent from all participating parties.
Associates
Associates are companies in which the Company has significant influence but does not have
control over its financial and operating policies. Significant influence is the power to participate in
decision-making regarding the financial and operating policies of the investee but does not include
control over those policies.
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates are initially recognized at cost, including
the purchase price or contributed capital, along with any directly attributable investment costs. If
the investment is made using non-monetary assets, the investment cost is recorded at the fair value
of the non-monetary assets at the transaction date.
Dividends and profits from periods before the investment acquisition are deducted from the
investment’s value. Dividends and profits from periods after the investment acquisition are
recognized as revenue. Dividends received in the form of shares are only recorded as an increase in
the number of shares held, without recognizing their value / are recorded at their par value.

NOTE TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
as at 31 March 2025 and for the three-month period then ended (continued)
A provision for impairment of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates is
recognized when these entities incur losses. The provision amount is determined as the difference
between the actual contributed capital of all parties in the subsidiary joint venture, or associate and
the entity’s actual equity, multiplied by the Company's ownership percentage relative to the total
actual contributed capital. If the subsidiary, joint venture, or associate is required to prepare
consolidated financial statements, the basis for determining the impairment provision is the
consolidated financial statements.
Increases or decreases in the provision for impairment of investments in subsidiaries, joint
ventures, and associates that need to be recognized at the financial period-end are recorded as
financial expenses.
5. Trade receivables and other receivables
Trade receivables and other receivables are recognized based on actual amounts incurred.
Receivables are presented at their carrying amount, net of any allowance for doubtful debts.
The classification of receivables as trade receivables, internal receivables and other receivables is
carried out according to the following principles:
• Trade receivables reflect trade-related receivables arising from purchase-sale transactions
between the company and buyers who are independent parties from the Company, including
receivables from entrusted export sales to other parties.
• Internal receivables represent amounts receivable from dependent units that do not have legal
entity status and operate under the Company's accounting system.
• Other receivables reflect non-trade receivables that are not related to purchase-sale
transactions.
A provision for doubtful debts is established for each doubtful receivable based on the overdue age
of the debts or the estimated potential loss, as specified below:
• For overdue receivables:
- 30% of the value for receivables overdue from 6 months to less than 1 year.
- 50% of the value for receivables overdue from 1 year to less than 2 years.
- 70% of the value for receivables overdue from 2 years to less than 3 years.
- 100% of the value for receivables overdue for 3 years or more.
For receivables that are not yet overdue but are unlikely to be recovered: the provision is
established based on the estimated potential loss.
6. Inventories
Inventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
The cost of inventories is determined as follows:
• Raw materials, goods: include purchase costs and other directly attributable costs incurred to
bring the inventory to its current location and condition.
• Finished goods include the cost of raw materials, direct labor, and related manufacturing
overhead allocated based on normal operating capacity.
• Work-in-progress costs include only the costs of main raw materials, labor costs, depreciation
of assets used in production activities, and other manufacturing overheads related to production
operations.

NOTE TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
as at 31 March 2025 and for the three-month period then ended (continued)
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventories in the normal course of production
and business operations, minus the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary
to sell them.
The value of inventory is determined using the weighted average method and is accounted for
using the perpetual inventory system.
A provision for inventory devaluation is established for each inventory item whose cost exceeds its
net realizable value. For unfinished services, the provision is determined based on each type of
service with a separate pricing structure. Increases or decreases in the provision for inventory
devaluation that need to be recognized at the financial year-end are recorded in cost of goods sold.
7. Tangible fixed assets
a) Principles of recording and depreciating tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are presented at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of tangible fixed
assets includes all expenses incurred by the company to acquire the asset and bring it into a
condition ready for use. Costs incurred after initial recognition are only added to the cost of
tangible fixed assets if these costs are expected to result in future economic benefits from the use of
the asset. Costs that do not meet this condition are immediately recognized as expenses.
When tangible fixed assets are sold or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed, and any resulting gain or loss from the disposal is recognized as income or expense in the
7 period.
y Tangible fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful
life. The depreciation periods for various types of tangible fixed assets are as follows:
Type of fixed assets Number of
years
Buildings and structures 10-25
Machineries and equipment 06-10
'A Means of transportation 06 -08
Office equipment 03-05
Others 05
8. Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are presented at their cost less accumulated amortization.
The cost of an intangible asset includes all expenses incurred by the Company to acquire the asset
until it is ready for use. Expenses related to intangible assets incurred after initial recognition are
recognized as production or business expenses for the period, unless these costs are directly
associated with a specific intangible asset and enhance its economic benefits.
When an intangible asset is sold or disposed of, its cost and accumulated amortization are removed
from the books, and any resulting gain or loss from the disposal is recognized as income or
expense in the year.

according to the management needs of the enterprise.
Payables that satisfy the definition of foreign currency items are revalued at the end of the period
when preparing the Financial Statements.
11. Borrowings and financial leases
The company must closely monitor the repayment terms of borrowings and financial leases.
Payable amounts with a repayment period of more than 12 months from the reporting date are
classified as long-term borrowings and financial leases. Amounts due for repayment within the
next 12 months from the reporting date are classified as short-term borrowings and financial leases

• Accounts payable to suppliers reflect trade payables arising from transactions involving the
purchase of goods, services, and assets, where the supplier is an independent entity from the
Company. This includes payables arising from imports through a consignee.
• Accrued expenses reflect amounts owed for goods or services received from the supplier or
provided to the buyer but not yet paid due to the absence of invoices or incomplete accounting
r documentation. It also includes payables to employees for wages, vacation pay, and other
production or business expenses that need to be accrued.
0(
^ • Internal payables reflect amounts owed between the parent company and its dependent
sa. branches that do not have legal status and are dependent on the parent company's accounting
system.
So
Other payables reflect amounts owed that are non-commercial in nature and not related to the
purchase, sale, or provision of goods and services.
14. Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive)
arising from a past event, and the settlement of this obligation is expected to result in an outflow of
economic benefits, with the value of the obligation being reliably estimated.
If the time value is material, the provision will be determined by discounting the future amount
required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate, reflecting current market assessments
of the time value of money and the specific risks of the obligation. The increase in the provision
due to the passage of time is recognized as a financial expense.

18. Accounting principles for revenue deductions
Revenue deductions include: Trade discounts, sales discounts, and sales returns.
Trade discounts, sales discounts, and sales returns that occur in the same period as the sale of
products, goods, or services are adjusted to reduce the revenue of the period in which they arise;
In cases where products, goods, or services have been sold in previous periods, and trade discounts,
sales discounts, or sales returns occur in a later period, the company is allowed to reduce revenue
based on the principle of adjusting the revenue in the period in which the discount, allowance, or
return is recognized:
+ If products, goods, or services that were consumed in previous periods require a price reduction,
a trade discount, or are returned, but the events occur before the financial report is issued,
accounting must treat this as an event requiring adjustment after the balance sheet date and reduce
revenue in the financial statements of the reporting period (the previous period).
+ In the case where products, goods, or services are subject to price reductions, trade discounts, or
returns after the financial report has been issued, the company must reduce the revenue of the
period in which the event occurs (the subsequent period).
19. Cost of Goods Sold
The cost of goods sold for the year is recognized in accordance with the revenue generated during
the period and ensures compliance with the prudence principle.
For direct material costs that exceed normal consumption, labor costs, and fixed production
overheads that are not allocated to the value of goods in inventory, accounting must immediately
include them in the cost of goods sold (after deducting any compensation, if applicable), even
when the products or goods have not been recognized as sold.
The provision for inventory write-down is included in the cost of goods sold based on the quantity
of inventory and the difference between the net realizable value and the original cost of the
inventory. When determining the volume of inventory to be written down, accounting must
exclude inventory that has been contracted for sale (with a net realizable value not lower than its
carrying value) but has not yet been transferred to the customer, if there is reliable evidence that
the customer will not withdraw from fulfilling the contract.
20. Financial expenses
\ It reflects financial operating costs, including expenses or losses related to financial investment
activities, loan and borrowing costs, joint venture and affiliate capital contribution costs, short-term
securities disposal losses, securities transaction costs; provision for impairment of trading
securities, provision for investment losses in other entities, losses arising from the sale of foreign
currencies, and foreign exchange rate losses....
21. Selling expenses and administrative expenses
Selling expenses reflect the actual costs incurred during the process of selling products, goods, or
providing services, including costs for offering, product promotion, advertising, sales
commissions, product warranty costs (excluding construction activities), storage, packaging, and
transportation costs...

Administrative expenses reflect the general management costs of the company, including expenses
for the salaries of company management staff (wages, salaries, allowances, etc.); social insurance,
health insurance, trade union funds, and unemployment insurance for the company's management
staff; office materials, labor tools, and depreciation of fixed assets used for company management;
land rent, business license tax; provisions for doubtful accounts receivable; outsourced services
(electricity, water, telephone, fax, property insurance, fire insurance, etc.); and other cash expenses
(entertainment, client meetings, etc...).
22. Corporate income tax
Current income tax
Current income tax is the tax calculated based on taxable income. The taxable income differs from
accounting profit due to adjustments for temporary differences between tax and accounting, non­
deductible expenses, as well as adjustments for income that is exempt from tax and carried-forward
losses.
The current statutory corporate income tax rate applicable to the Company is 20%.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is the income tax that will be paid or refunded due to temporary differences
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax
base. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred
income tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable
profits in the future to utilize the temporary differences that can be deducted.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and is
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to
allow the benefit of some or all of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Deferred income tax assets
that have not been previously recognized are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and are
recognized when it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to utilize the
unrecognized deferred tax assets.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are determined based on the tax rates
expected to apply in the years when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, using the tax rates
enacted at the end of the fiscal year. Deferred income tax is recognized in the statement of profit or
loss and is only directly recognized in equity when the tax is related to items recognized directly in
equity.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset when:
• The company has the legal right to offset the current income tax assets with the current income
tax liabilities payable.
• The deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are related to corporate
income tax managed by the same tax authority.
The company intends to settle the current income tax liabilities and current income tax assets on a
net basis or recover the assets simultaneously with the settlement of liabilities in each future period
when the significant amounts of deferred income tax liabilities or deferred income tax assets are
settled or recovered.

Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are determined by the initial carrying amount of the
financial liability, less any principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization of the
difference between the initial canying amount and the maturity value, calculated using the
effective interest method, less any impairments (either directly or through the use of a provision
account) due to a decrease in value or non-recovery.
The effective interest method is the method used to calculate the amortized cost of a financial
liability or group of financial liabilities and allocate interest income or expense over the relevant
period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows that will
be paid or received throughout the expected life of the financial instrument, or shorter if necessary,
to the net present value of the financial liability.
The initial carrying amount of a financial liability
At initial recognition, financial liabilities are determined at the issue price plus any directly
attributable costs incurred in issuing the financial liability.
Hi. Equity instruments
Equity instruments are contracts that represent a residual interest in the assets of the company after
deductingall liabilities.

3. Financial Risk Management
The Company's operations give rise to the following financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk, and
market risk. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing policies and controls to mitigate
financial risks, as well as overseeing the implementation of the established policies and controls.
A, Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party involved in a contract is unable to fulfill its obligations,
resulting in financial losses for the Company.
The Company faces credit risks primarily arising from accounts receivable from customers and
bank deposits.
Accounts receivable from customers
The Company minimizes credit risk by only engaging in transactions with financially stable
entities, requiring the opening of letters of credit or securing assets for first-time or unknown
financial entities. Additionally, the accounts receivable staff regularly monitors outstanding debts
to expedite collections.
k The Company's accounts receivable from customers are related to multiple entities and individuals,
so the credit risk concentration for accounts receivable is low.
o
Term deposits
_ The Company's term and non-term bank deposits are placed at domestic banks. The Board of
Directors does not perceive any significant credit risk from these deposits.
Loans
The Company lends money to its subsidiaries and key management members. These entities and
individuals are all reputable and have good payment capacity, so the credit risk for the loans is
low.
B, Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the company faces difficulties in meeting its financial obligations due
to a lack of cash.
The Board of General Directors is ultimately responsible for managing liquidity risk. The
company's liquidity risk primarily arises from the mismatch in the maturity dates of financial assets
and financial liabilities.
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining an appropriate amount of cash and cash
equivalents, as well as loans at a level deemed sufficient by the Board of Directors to meet the
Company's operational needs, in order to minimize the impact of cash flow fluctuations.

low. The Company has the ability to settle due debts through cash flows from operating activities
and proceeds from maturing financial assets. The Company has access to sufficient sources of
funding and loans maturing within 12 months can be rolled over with existing lenders.
C, Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
Market risk includes three types: foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and other price risks.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument
will fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates.
The company imports raw materials for production and exports products with the main transaction
currencies being USD and EUR, so it is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.
The Company manages risks related to exchange rate fluctuations by optimizing debt payment
terms, forecasting foreign exchange rates, maintaining a reasonable loan and debt structure
between foreign currencies and VND, choosing the time to buy and pay foreign currencies at low
exchange rates, and optimally using existing cash resources to balance exchange rate risks and
liquidity risks.
Commodity/raw material price risk
The Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in commodity/raw material prices. The
Company manages commodity/raw material price risk by closely monitoring relevant market
information and situations to manage purchase timing, production planning and inventory levels
appropriately.
The Company has not used derivative instruments to hedge commodity/raw material price risks.

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is reflected at the value that the financial
instrument could be exchanged for in a current transaction between knowledgeable and willing
parties.
The company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate fair value:
• The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans, other receivables,
borrowings, payables to suppliers and other short-term payables is equivalent to the book
value (less the provision for the estimated uncollectible portion) of these items due to their
short maturity.
• The fair value of held-to-maturity investments and ready-for-sale financial assets listed on
the stock market is the published transaction price at the end of the accounting period. For
unlisted held-to-maturity investments and ready-for-sale financial assets with transaction
prices published by 3 securities companies at the end of the accounting period, the fail-
value of these investments is the average price based on the transaction prices published by
3 securities companies..
• The fair value of loans, trade receivables, other receivables, borrowings, trade payables
and other long-term payables, held-to-maturity investments that are not listed on the stock
market and do not have a trading price announced by 3 securities companies is estimated
by discounting cash flows at the interest rate applicable to debts with similar
characteristics and remaining maturity.
