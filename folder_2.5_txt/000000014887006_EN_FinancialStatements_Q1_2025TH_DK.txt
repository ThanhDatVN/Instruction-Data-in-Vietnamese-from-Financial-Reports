36 Explanation for the change by more than 10% in the 1st quarter 2025 business results compared to the same period last year:
Business results in the first quarter of 2025 decreased by more than 10% compared to the same period in 2024 due to the following main
reasons:
- Operating profit during the period increased by over VND 15 billion compared to the same period in 2024, mainly due to maritime
transport increasing by more than VND 10.5 billion, and gross profit from sales and service provision increasing by over VND 4 billion.
This was attributed to the Company effectively taking advantage of the market opportunity of slightly increased freight rates, combined
with the implementation of cost-saving measures, contributing to a reduction in cost of goods sold and improved efficiency.
- Other profit decreased by VND 43.5 billion, mainly due to reduced income from financial settlements as banks and credit institutions
reduced obligations related to debt repayments.

4 Financial risk management:
Financial risk includes market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and cash flow risk. The Company does not implement measures to mitigate
these risks due to the lack of a market for purchasing such instruments.
Market risk: The Company purchases raw materials, goods, tools, and supplies from both domestic and foreign suppliers to support its
business operations. Therefore, the Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the prices of these materials, goods, tools, and
supplies. This risk is mitigated by sourcing from a diverse range of suppliers located in various countries and regions, as well as
maintaining flexibility in negotiating and adjusting sale prices to customers in response to significant price fluctuations in the market.
Credit risk: Consist of liquidity risk and interest rate risk: The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that funds are available to
meet current and future liabilities. The Company's policy is to regularly monitor the liquidity requirements for current and expected future
liabilities to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
