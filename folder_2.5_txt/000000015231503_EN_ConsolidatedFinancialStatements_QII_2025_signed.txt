Page-025- Accounting principles and financial investment items:
a) Trading securities
’ An investment is classified as trading securities when it is held for the purpose of buying and selling to make a profit.
Trading securities are recorded at historical cost in the accounting books. The cost of trading securities is determined by the
fair value of payments made at the time of the transaction, Total any transaction costs associated with the purchase of
trading securities.
The recognition time for trading securities is the time when the company gains ownership rights, as follows:
+ For listed securities, they are recognized at the time the order is matched (T+0).
+ For unlisted securities, they are recognized at the time the ownership rights are officially obtained according to relevant
legal regulations.
Interest, dividends, and profits from periods, which are before the investment is acquired, are accounted for as a reduction
in the value of the trading securities. Interest, dividends, and profits from periods after the trading securities are purchased
are recognized as financial income. Dividends received in the form of stock dividends are tracked only in terms of the
increase in the number of shares, without recognizing the value of the shares received, or are recorded at face value.
Convertible shares are determined at fair value on the exchange date. The fair value of shares is determined as follows:
+For listed shares, the fair value is the closing price on the stock market at the exchange date. If the stock market does not
trade on the exchange date, the fair value of the shares is the closing price of the preceding trading session.
+For unlisted shares traded on the UPCOM market, the fair value is the closing price of the shares on the UPCOM market
at the exchange date. If the UPCOM market does not trade on the exchange date, the fair value is the closing price of the
preceding trading session.
+For other unlisted shares, the fair value is either the price agreed upon by the parties in the contract or the book value at
the time of the exchange. ;*=
- A provision for the devaluation of trading securities is made for each type of security traded on the market where the •* J
market value is lower than the historical cost. Regarding the determination of the fair value of listed trading securities on 1 ^
the stock exchange or those traded on the UPCOM market, the fair value of listed trading securities is the closing price at
the end of the fiscal year. . M
In case the stock market or the UPCOM market does not trade on the fiscal year-end date, the fair value is determined by —
the closing price of the preceding trading session. ^
Any increase or decrease In the provision for the devaluation of trading securities at the end of the fiscal year is recognized
as financial expense.
bj Held-to-maturity investments
Investments are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the intention and ability to hold them until maturity.
Held-to-maturity investments include: term deposits (including promissory notes and bills of exchange), bonds, preferred
shares with a mandatory buyback by the issuer at a specified future time, and held-to-maturity loans for earning periodic
i merest, and other held-to-maturity investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at historical cost, which includes the purchase price and any related
transaction costs. After initial recognition, these investments are recorded at recoverable value. Interest income from held-
to-maturity investments after the purchase date is recognized in the income statement on an accrual basis. Interest earned
prior to the purchase is deducted from the cost at the time of purchase.
When there is strong evidence that part or all of the investment may not be recoverable and the loss is reliably determined,
the loss is recognized as a financial expense for the year and is directly deducted from the investment’s value.
c) investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates
Subsidiary:
Subsidiaries are enterprises controlled by the parent company. Control is achieved when the parent company has the ability
to control the financial and operating policies of the investee to obtain economic benefits from its activities.

Joint ventures are enterprises established based on an agreement between parties, under which the company and the
participants conduct economic activities on (he basis of joint control. Joint control means that strategic decisions regarding
the operational and financial policies of the joint venture must be made with the consensus of all participants tn the joint
venture.
Associate:
Associates are enterprises in which the company has significant influence but does not have control over the financial and
operational policies. Significant influence is evidenced by the right to participate in making decisions regarding the financial
and operational policies of the investee company, but without controlling those policies.
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associated companies are initially recognized at historical cost, which
includes the purchase price or capital contribution, Total any directly related costs. In case of investments are made with non­
monetary assets, the investment value is recognized based on the fair value of the non-monetary asset at the time of the
transaction.
Dividends and profits of the periods, which are before the investment is acquired, are accounted for as a reduction of the
investment value. Dividends and profits from periods after the investment is acquired are recognized as income. Dividends
received in the form of stock dividends are tracked only in terms of the increase in the number of shares, without recognizing
the value of the shares received, or are recorded at face value.
A provision for losses on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associated companies is made when the
subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associated companies incur losses, with the provision calculated as the difference between
the actual capital contributions of the parties at the investee companies and the actual shareholders' equity, multiplied by the
company's contribution ratio relative to the total capital contribution of the parties involved. If the subsidiary, joint venture,
or associated company prepares consolidated financial statements, the basis for determining the provision is the consolidated
financial statements.
Any increase or decrease in the provision for losses on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associated companies
at the end of the fiscal year is recognized as a financial expense.

capital contribution of the parties involved.
