4. Financial instruments
On November 6, 2009, the Ministry of Finance issued Circular No, 210/2009/TT-BTC guiding the
application of International Accounting Standards on the presentation of financial statements and
disclosures for financial instruments ("Circular 210"), effective for financial statements from 2011
onwards. However, Circular 210 does not provide equivalent guidance for the evaluation and recognition
of financial instruments including the application of fair value in accordance with International
Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards, The Company's assets and
liabilities are still recorded and accounted for in accordance with the current provisions of Vietnamese
Accounting Standards and the Vietnamese Accounting System.
Financial Risk Management
The Company's financial liabilities mainly consist of loans, trade payables and other short-term payables,
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to mobilize financial resources to serve the Company's
operations, The Company also has financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables
and other receivables arising directly from the Company's operations.The Company does not hold or
issue derivative financial instruments.
The material risks arising from the Company's financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and
liquidity risk.
Risk management is an indispensable function for the entire business operations of the Company, The
Company has established a control system to ensure a reasonable balance between the cost of risks
incurred and the cost of risk management. The Board of Management continuously monitors the
Company's risk management process to ensure a reasonable balance between risks and controls, risks.
The Board of Management reviews and agrees to apply management policies for the above risks as
follows;
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market prices. Market prices have four types of risks: interest rate risk, currency
risk, commodity price risk and other price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include
cash, trade receivables, trade payables and other payables.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market interest rates. The Company's market risk from changes in interest rates
relates primarily to the Company's long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.
The Company has no interest rate risk during the year because the Company's borrowings have fixed
interest rates.
Commodity price risk
The Company does not have significant commodity price risk. The Company manages commodity price
risk by closely monitoring relevant information and situations of the commodity market and through
suppliers to manage the timing of purchases, production plans and inventory levels appropriately.

SEPARATE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the three-month period ended 31 March 2025
Notes to the separate interim fianacial statements (continue)
The Company has not used derivative financial instruments to hedge commodity price risks.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a party to a financial instrument or customer contract will not meet its
obligations, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating
activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including bank deposits.
Trade and other receivables
The Company manages credit risk by regularly monitoring outstanding receivables and seeking to
maintain close control over outstanding receivables at the reporting date.
Bank deposits
The Company mainly maintains deposit balances with well-known banks in Vietnam. Credit risk for
deposit balances with banks is managed by the Company's treasury department in accordance with the
Company's policy. The Company's maximum credit risk for items in the balance sheet at each financial
reporting period is the canying amount as presented in Note 3. The Company considers that the
concentration of credit risk for bank deposits is low.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will have difficulty in fulfilling its financial obligations due to
lack of capital, The Company's liquidity risk arises mainly from the fact that financial assets and financial
liabilities have different maturities.
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining a level of cash and cash equivalents and bank loans
at a level that the Board of Directors considers adequate to meet the Company's operations and to
minimize the impact of fluctuations in cash flows.
The table below summarizes the maturity of the Company's financial liabilities based on expected
contractual payments on a discounted basis as follows:

instrument could be converted in a current transaction between the parlies, except in the event of a
forced sale or liquidation.

1. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and other short-term
liabilities is equivalent to the carrying value of these items as a result of these instruments short
teim.
2. The fair value'of listed securities and financial debt instruments is determined according to the
market price at the reporting date.
3. Fair value of securities and financial investments whose fair value cannot be determined with
certainty because there is no highly liquid market for securities and investments, This financial
statement is presented at book value.
4. Bank loans and financial liabilities whose fair value cannot be determined with certainty because
there is no liquid market for loans and financial liabilities This is presented at book value
