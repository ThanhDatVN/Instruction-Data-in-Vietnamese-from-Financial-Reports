Reasons: In Q2/2025, profit after corporate income tax increase compared to
Q2/2024 mainly due to the following reasons:
- Revenue from sales of goods and rendering of services increased by 34.34%
compared to the same period last year, mainly from industrial park businesses, port
services and garbage collection and waste treatment services.
- Cost of goods sold growth rate is lower than revenue growth rate (increase
13.44%) caused the gross profit from sales of goods and rendering of services
increased by 60.34% compared to the same period last year.
- Share of the profit of associates and net other income increased respectively
by 390.39% and 343.15% compared to the same period last year.
- Selling expense decreased by 18.65% compared to the same period last year.
This led to a 60.63% increase in total accounting profit before tax, resulting in a
56.21% increase in profit after corporate income tax compared to the same period last
year.
Sonadezi Corporation provides an explanation to the State Securities
Commission, the Hanoi Stock Exchange and shareholders for information.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
2.1. Accounting standards, accounting system
The accompanying consolidated financial statements, expressed in Vietnamese Dong (“VND”), are
prepared in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, Vietnamese Corporate Accounting
System.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are not intended to present the consolidated
financial position, consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows in accordance with
accounting principles and practices generally accepted in countries and jurisdictions other than
Vietnam.
2.2. Financial year
The Group’s financial year is from 01 January to 31 December.
2.3. Reporting and functional currency
The Group maintains its accounting records in VND.
2.4. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are the financial statements of a Group in which the assets,
liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent and subsidiaries are presented as
those of a single economic entity regardless of the legal structure of the entities. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries have been prepared for the same financial year using uniform
accounting policies to those used by the parent company. Adjustments were made for any different
accounting policies to ensure consistency between the subsidiaries and the parent company.
A subsidiary is fully consolidated from the acquisition date on which the Group obtains control over
the subsidiary until the date on which the parent ceases to control the subsidiary, unless control is
intended to be temporary because the subsidiary is acquired and held exclusively with the intention
of selling or disposing of it within twelve months.
Non-controlling interest recognition
Non-controlling interests in the net assets and net results of consolidated subsidiaries are shown
separately in the consolidated statement of financial position and in the consolidated income
statement.
The loss of a subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative
interests in the subsidiary even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Profit or loss recognition in changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries
Changes in the Group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the Group losing
control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group’s and the non­
controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary.
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair
value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity in the consolidated
statement of financial position.
Upon loss of control of a subsidiary, the Group’s profit or loss is calculated as the difference between
the fair value of the consideration received and the respective carrying amount of the net asset of the
subsidiary plus the remaining balance of goodwill at the date when control is lost.

Address: No. 1, Road 1, Bien Hoa 1 Industrial Park, An Binh Ward,
Bien Hoa City, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Intra-group transactions elimination
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses - including unrealised intra-group profits
or losses - are eliminated in full on consolidation. Unrealised losses resulting from intra-group
transactions that are deducted in arriving at the carrying amount of assets are also eliminated unless
the cost cannot be recovered.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.1. Foreign currencies
■ The exchange rates announced by banks of companies in the Group are applied in accounting;
■ The exchange rate applicable to asset recognition and re-evaluation is the foreign currency­
buying rate;
■ The exchange rate applicable to liability recognition and re-evaluation is the foreign currency­
selling rate.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded, on initial recognition, in the reporting currency, by
applying to the foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the reporting currency and
the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. The exchange differences arising on the
settlement of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. At the
end of the reporting year, monetary items excluding advances to suppliers, prepaid expenses, and
unearned revenues, which are denominated in foreign currency, are reported using the closing rate
and resultant exchange differences resulting from the reporting after offset are recognised in profit or
loss in the year in which they arise.
3.2. Use of estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that impact the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, contingent assets ^
and liabilities reported in the notes at 30 June 2025 as well as revenues and expenses in the \ffif
consolidated financial statements for the financial period from 01 January 2025 to 30 June 2025.
Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of all relevant information
available at the date when the consolidated financial statements are prepared, this does not prevent
actual figures differing from estimates.
3.3. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank and current investments for a
period not exceeding 3 months or highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash equivalents are defined the same as those under Accounting Standard No. 24 - Statement of
cash flows.
3.4. Financial investments
Held to maturity investments
Held to maturity investments comprise term deposits.
Equity investments in other entities
Investments in associates
Investments are classified as investments in associates when the Group directly or indirectly holds
from 20% to under 50% of the voting shares of the investee without any other agreement.
15SONADEZI CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES
Address: No. 1, Road 1, Bien Hoa 1 Industrial Park, An Binh Ward,
Bien Hoa City, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, on
initial recognition the investment in an associate is recognised at cost. In case of investments of non­
monetary assets, the cost of investments is recognised at the fair values of the assets as incurred.
The carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the Group’s share of profit or loss of the
associate after the date of acquisition.
Distributions received from associates reduce the carrying amount of the investment.
Other investments
Investments classified as other investments are investments other than investments in subsidiaries,
investments in associates or investments on joint ventures.
Other investments are accounted for under the cost method which comprise purchase prices plus (+)
acquisition related costs (if any). In case of investments of non-monetary assets, the cost of
investments is recognised at the fair values of the assets as incurred.
Recognition principles of provisions for other financial investment impairment loss
For investments in securities
As of the date of the consolidated financial statements, with regard to the investments in securities
that are listed or registered for trading in the domestic stock markets and freely traded in the market,
if the market price of the securities is below their carrying amounts, a provision for a securities
investment impairment loss is recognised at no more than the carrying amount to reflect the loss due
to the impairment to ensure that the value of the investments is no more than the market price.
ONG
For equity investments in other entities CO
iAt
Provisions for impairment losses on equity investments in other entities are determined using fair
values if the fair values can measure reliably. If the fair values cannot be measure reliably at the
reporting date, provisions are measured on the basis of the investee's losses.
3.5. Account receivables
Recognition method
Account receivables are stated at the carrying amounts of trade receivables and other receivables
less provisions for doubtful debts.
Provisions for doubtful debts
As of the date of the consolidated financial statements, provisions for doubtful debts are recognised
for past-due accounts receivable and for accounts receivable where circumstances indicate that they
