- The securities and other financial instruments such as commercial bill, forward contracts, swap contracts ...
Trading securities are recorded at original cost at the time when investors hold ownership.
The dividends paid in the period before investment date shall be recorded as a decrease in value of investment. When
the investor receives additional shares without payment to issuer from capital surplus shares, capital expenditure funds
or dividends in shares, the investors only monitor the quantity of additional shares.
In case shares are exchanged, its value must be determined according to fair value at the exchanging date.
The cost shall be determined in accordance with weighted average method when trading securities are liquidated or
transferred.
Provisions for decline in value of trading securities: the value of loss may occur if there are reliable evidences
showing the market value of the Company's trading securities are lower than book value. The provision shall be
additionally created or reverted at the reporting date and shall be recorded in financial expense.

These investments do not reflect bonds and debt instruments which are held for trading purpose. Held to maturity
investments include term deposits (maturity over than 3 months), treasury bills, promissory notes, bonds, preference
shares which the issuer is required to re-buy them in a certain time and held to maturity loans to earn profits periodically
and other held to maturity investments.
Provision for Impairment of Held-to-Maturity Investments: For held-to-maturity investments not yet provisioned as
required by law, the Company must assess their recoverability. If there is conclusive evidence that a portion or the
entirety of the investment may not be recoverable, the loss must be recognized as a financial expense during the period.
The provisioning or reversal of this provision is carried out at the time of preparing the financial statements. If the loss
amount cannot be reliably determined, the investment value will not be reduced, and the recoverability of the
investment will be disclosed in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
c. Investments in joint ventures, associates
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted for using the cost method. Net profit distributed by subsidiaries
and associates arising after the investment date is recognized as financial income during the period. Other distributions
(apart from net profit) are considered a recovery of the investment and are recorded as a deduction from the investment's
cost.
Joint venture operations under joint control and jointly controlled assets are accounted for using general accounting
principles, similar to other normal business activities. Specifically:

5. Principles for Recognition and Depreciation of Fixed Assets, Finance-Leased Fixed Assets, and Investment
Fixed assets are recorded at their original cost. During their usage, fixed assets are monitored in detail for original cost,
accumulated depreciation, and remaining value.
The original cost of finance-leased fixed assets is recorded at the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the
minimum lease payments (in cases where the fair value exceeds the present value of the minimum lease payments), plus
any direct initial costs related to the finance lease.
During usage, the Company depreciates fixed assets into production and business expenses for those fixed assets related
to production and business activities. Specifically, for intangible fixed assets such as land use rights, depreciation is
only calculated for those intangible fixed assets with a limited duration.
Investment properties are depreciated like fixed assets, except for investment properties held for appreciation, which are
not depreciated but are assessed for impairment due to a decrease in value.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method. The depreciation period is estimated as follows:
- Buildings and structures 05-30 year
- Machinery and equipment 05-30 year
- Transportation & transmit instrument 05-10 year
- Office equipment 05-10 year
- Other intangible fixed assets 05-25 year

receive back this advance in foreign currency, this advance will be treated as monetary item having foreign currency) at
the selling price quoted by commercial bank which is trading with the Company at the reporting date.
9. Principles for Recognizing Loans and Finance Lease Liabilities
Loans in the form of bond issues or preference shares that require the issuer to repurchase at a certain time in the future
are not reflected in this item.
Loans and debts should be tracked in detail for each object, each contract and each type of loaned asset. Leases are
stated at the present value of minimum rental payments or the fair value of the leased property.

10. Recognition of loans and finance lease liabilities
Borrowing costs directly related to loans are recognized as financial expenses in the period, except in cases where

Accounts payable for goods and services received from the seller or provided to the buyer in the period but actually not
paid due to lack of invoices or insufficient records, accounting documents and accounts payable to employees are
recorded in production costs, business in the period to ensure that when costs are actually incurred, they do not cause a
spike in production and business costs on the basis of ensuring the principle of conformity between revenue and costs.
The advance deduction of payable costs must be calculated strictly and there must be reasonable and reliable evidence.
When such costs arise, if there is a discrepancy with the deducted amount, the accountant shall proceed to write down
additional or reduce costs corresponding to the difference.
12. Accounting principles of owner's equity
a. Principles for recognizing owner contributions, capital surplus, convertible bond options, and other
owner equity
Equity of the owners is recorded according to the actual contributed capital of the owner.
When the investment license specifies that the company's charter capital is denominated in foreign currencies, the
determination of the investor's contribution in foreign currency is based on the amount of foreign currency actually
Contributions in the form of assets are recorded as an increase in shareholders' equity at the revalued value of the assets,
as agreed upon by the contributing parties. For intangible assets such as trademarks, brand names, trade names,
exploration and development rights, etc., contributions can only be increased if permitted by applicable laws.
For joint-stock companies, the share capital contributed by shareholders is recorded according to the actual price of
share issuance, but is reflected in two separate indicators:
- The owner's contributed capital is recognized at the par value of the shares;
- The share capital surplus is recognized in the amount of the difference greater or smaller between the actual price of
the share issuance and the par value.
In addition, the equity surplus is also recognized in the amount of the greater or smaller difference between the actual
price of the issue and the par value of shares when reissuing treasury shares.
The convertible bond option arises when a company issues a type of bond that can be converted into a predetermined
number of shares specified in the issuance plan. The equity component value of the convertible bond is the difference
between the total proceeds from the issuance of the convertible bond and the debt component value of the convertible
bond. At the time of initial recognition, the value of the stock option of the convertible bond is recorded separately in
the equity section of the owner's investment. Upon maturity of the bond, this option is reclassified to additional paid-in
capital.
Other Capital reflects business capital formed from additions through business results, gifts, donations, sponsorships, or
asset revaluation (in accordance with current regulations).

4. Information about the departmental report:
The company does not prepare segment reports (as it does not meet the conditions for preparing segment reports).
5. Risk management of the Company:
The Company's financial liabilities primarily include loans, accounts payable to suppliers, and other payables. The
main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise funds to support the Company's operations. The Company has
financial assets such as accounts receivable from customers and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits,
and investments in listed and unlisted securities that arise directly from the Company's activities.
The significant risks arising from the Company's financial instruments are market risk, credit risk, and liquidity
risk.
Risk management is an essential function for the overall business operations of the Company. The Company has
established a control system to ensure a reasonable balance between the costs incurred when risks arise and the
costs of managing those risks. The Board of Directors continuously monitors the Company's risk management
process to ensure a reasonable balance between risk and risk control.
The Board of Directors of the Company reviews and agrees to implement the management policies for the
aforementioned risks as follows:
5.1. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes
in market prices. Market risk includes three types of risks: currency risk, interest rate risk, and price risk. Financial
instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, corporate bonds, convertible bonds, deposits,
and financial investments.
The sensitivity analysis presented below is based on the assumption that the value of the net debt and the ratio
between fixed-rate and floating-rate debts remain unchanged.
a. Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due
to changes in exchange rates. The risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates for the Company primarily
relates to its operations (when revenues or expenses are denominated in foreign currencies different from the
Company's functional currency).
b. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to
changes in market interest rates.
The company's interest rate risk primarily relates to cash, short-term deposits, and loans.
The company manages interest rate risk by analyzing market conditions to secure the most favorable interest rates
while remaining within its risk management limits.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Second Quarter of 2025
Unit: VND
The company does not conduct sensitivity analysis for interest rates because the risk from interest rate changes at
the reporting date is negligible.
c. Price risk
Stock Price Risk:
The listed and unlisted stocks held by the Company are affected by market risks arising from the uncertainty
regarding the future value of investment stocks, which may lead to fluctuations in the value of the investment
impairment provision. The Company manages stock price risk by establishing investment limits. The Board of
Directors also reviews and approves investment decisions related to stocks.
The Company will conduct an analysis and present the sensitivity of the impact of stock price fluctuations on the
Company's business results when detailed guidelines are provided by regulatory authorities.
Real Estate Price Risk:
The Company has identified the following risks related to its real estate investment portfolio:
- The costs of development projects may increase if there are delays in the planning process. To mitigate this risk,
the Company hires consulting experts specializing in specific planning requirements within the project scope to
reduce potential risks that may arise during the planning phase.
- The risk of fair value of the real estate investment portfolio due to market fundamentals and buyer behavior.
5.2. Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party involved in a financial instrument or transaction contract fails to fulfill its
obligations, resulting in financial loss. The company faces credit risk primarily from its business operations related
to accounts receivable from customers and from financial activities, including bank deposits, foreign exchange, and
other financial instruments.
a. Regarding Accounts Receivable from Customers
The company mitigates credit risk by conducting transactions only with entities that have good financial standing
and by having its accounting staff regularly monitor receivables to expedite collection. Based on this, the
company's receivables are spread across many different customers, ensuring that credit risk is not concentrated in a
sinele customer.
b. Regarding Bank Deposits
The company mainly maintains deposit balances with well-known banks in Vietnam. The credit risk associated
with the deposit balances is managed by the company's treasury department according to the company's policies.
The company assesses that the level of credit risk concentration related to bank deposits is low.
5.3. Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will face difficulties in meeting its financial obligations due to a lack of
capital. The company's liquidity risk primarily arises from the mismatched maturities of financial assets and
financial liabilities.

The Board of Directors holds the ultimate responsibility for managing liquidity risk. Most of the company’s
liabilities are secured by deposits, receivables, and short-term financial assets. The company assesses that the
concentration of liquidity risk related to fulfilling financial obligations is low.
The company manages liquidity risk by maintaining a sufficient amount of cash and cash equivalents relative to the
borrowings, as deemed adequate by the Board of Directors, to meet the company’s operational needs and reduce
the impact of fluctuations in cash flow.
