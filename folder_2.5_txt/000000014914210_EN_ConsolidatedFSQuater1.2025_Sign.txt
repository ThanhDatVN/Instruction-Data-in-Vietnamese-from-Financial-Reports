goods;
- Revenue is determined with relative certainty;

- Determine the costs associated with the sales transaction.
Revenue from the provision of services is recognized when the result of the transaction is reliably determined. In
case the transaction of providing services involves many years, the revenue recorded in the year corresponds to
the part of the work completed at the end of the accounting year of that year. Revenue from service provision is
