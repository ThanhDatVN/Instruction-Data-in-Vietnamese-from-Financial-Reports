reference to the specific costs incurred on the property sold and an allocation of any non­
specific costs based on the relative size of the property sold.
Other inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost incurred in bringing each product to its present
location and condition, and net realizable value.
Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business
less the estimated costs to complete and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
The perpetual method is used to record inventories, which are valued as follows:
Merchandise - cost of purchase on a weighted average basis
Tools and supplies - cost of purchase on a weighted average basis
Provision for obsolete inventories
An inventory provision is created for the estimated loss arising due to the impairment of value
(through diminution, damage, obsolescence, etc.) of raw materials, finished goods, and other
inventories owned by the Company, based on appropriate evidence of impairment available
at the balance sheet date.
Increases or decreases to the provision balance are recorded into the cost of goods sold
account in the separate income statement. When inventories are expired, obsolescence,
damage or become useless, the difference between the provision previously made and the

differences can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available
to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Previously unrecognized deferred
tax assets are re-assessed at each balance sheet date and are recognized to the extent that
it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax assets to be
recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws
that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the separate income statement, except when it relates
to items recognized directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in the
equity account.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right for the
Company to off-set current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on:
► either the same taxable entity; or
> when the Company intends either settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or
to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which
significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or
recovered.
