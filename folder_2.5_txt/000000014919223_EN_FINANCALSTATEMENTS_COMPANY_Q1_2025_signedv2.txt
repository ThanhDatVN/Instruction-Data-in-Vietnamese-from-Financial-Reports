acquired, are recognized as revenue. Dividends received in the form of shares are only tracked for
the additional number of shares issued, without recognizing the value of the shares received.
A provision for loss on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and affiliate companies is made
when these companies report losses. The provision is calculated as the difference between the
actual capital contribution from all parties in the subsidiary joint venture, or affiliate company and
the actual equity value, multiplied by the company’s capital contribution ratio to the total actual
capital contributed by all parties in these companies. If the subsidiary, joint venture, or affiliate
company is subject to consolidated financial statements, the basis for determining the loss provision
is the consolidated financial statements.

and affiliate companies must be recognized as a financial expense at the end of the financial year.

Deferred income tax is the corporate income tax that will be payable or refunded due to temporary
differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the tax base. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary
differences. Deferred income tax assets are only recognized when it is certain that future taxable
profits will be available to utilize these temporary differences.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of the accounting period
and will be written down to the amount that ensures it is more likely than not that there will be
sufficient taxable profits to allow the benefit of some or all of the deferred income tax asset to be
realized. Deferred income tax assets that have not been previously recognized are reviewed at the
end of the accounting period and are recognized when it is certain that there will be enough taxable
profits to use these previously unrecognized deferred income tax assets.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the tax rates that are expected to
apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted at
the end of the accounting period. Deferred income tax is recognized in the income statement, and
only recognized directly in owner’s equity when the tax relates to items that are directly recorded in
owner’s equity.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities can be offset when:
