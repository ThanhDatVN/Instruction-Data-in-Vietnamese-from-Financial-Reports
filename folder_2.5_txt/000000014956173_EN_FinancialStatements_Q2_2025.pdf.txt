We have reviewed the interim consolidated financial statements tor the first six months of the fiscal
year ending on September 30. 2025. attached to the report of Yen Bai Joint Stock l ores! Agricultural
Products and Foodstuff*Company, prepared on Max 12. 2025, from page 07 to page 44. which includes
the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31. 2025. the consolidated statement of operations, the
consolidated cash flow statement for the first six months of the fiscal year ending September 30. 2025.
and the notes to the interim consolidated financial statements.
Responsibility of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors of Yen Bai Joint Stock Forest Agricultural Products And Foodstuff Company is
responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements for
the first six months of the fiscal year ending on September 30. 2025, in accordance with accounting
standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting System, and relevant legal regulations related to the

internal controls it deems necessary to ensure that the preparation and presentation of the interim
consolidated financial statements for the first six months of the fiscal year ending on September 30,
2025, are free from material misstatements due to fraud or error.
Responsibility of the Auditor
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim consolidated financial statements for the
first six months of the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2025. based on our review. We conducted
our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review Engagements No. 2410 Review of
Interim Financial In formal ion Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity for the first six
months of the fiscal year ending on September 30, 2025.
The review of the interim financial information for the first six months of the fiscal year ending on
September 30. 2025, consists primarily of inquiries, mainly of personnel responsible for financial and
accounting matters, and the application of analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Auditing Standards
and. consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

3. Financial risk management
The Company’s operations give rise to the following financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk, and
market risk. The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing policies and controls to mitigate
these financial risks, as well as overseeing the implementation of the established policies and
controls.
A, Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party in a contract will not be able to fulfill its obligations, leading to
financial losses for the Company.
The Company faces credit risks primarily arising from accounts receivable from customers and
bank deposits.
Accounts receivable from customers
fhc Company mitigates credit risk by conducting transactions only with entities that have strong
financial capabilities, requiring the opening of letters of credit or collateral for first-time
transactions or when financial information is unavailable. In addition, the accounts receivable staff
regularly monitors outstanding debts to ensure timely collection.
The Company’s accounts receivable from customers are related to multiple entities and
individuals, so the credit risk concentration for accounts receivable is low.
Bank deposits
The Company’s lime deposits and demand deposits arc held at domestic banks. The Board of
Directors does not identify any significant credit risk arising from these deposits.
B, Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company may face difficulties in fulfilling its financial
obligations due to a lack ofcash.
The Board of Directors holds the ultimate responsibility for managing liquidity risk. The
Company's liquidity risk primarily arises from the mismatch in the maturity dates of' its financial
assets and financial liabilities.
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining an appropriate level of cash and cash
equivalents, as well as loans at a level deemed sufficient by the Board of Directors to meet the
Company’s operational needs, thereby minimizing the impact ofcash flow fluctuations

Total 22,816,619,381 26,850,000 - 22.843.469,381
The Company believes that the concentration of risk related to debt repayment is low. The
Company has the ability to meet its maturing liabilities from cash flows generated by its operations
and proceeds from maturing financial assets.
C, Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument w ill fluctuate
due to changes in market prices. Market risk includes three types: currency risk, interest rate risk,
and other price risks.
fhe sensitivity analysis presented below is based on the assumption that the value of the net debt
and the ratio of fixed interest rate debt to floating interest rale debt remain unchanged.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument
will fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument w ill
fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
I he Company's interest rate risk primarily relates to its borrowings.
The Company manages interest rate risk by analyzing market conditions to secure the most
favorable interest rates while staying within its risk management limits.
Other price risk
Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument w ill
fluctuate due to changes in market prices, excluding changes in interest rates and exchange rates.

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is reflected at the value at which Ihe
financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable and
willing parties.
fhe Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value:
• The fair value ofcash, short-term bank deposits, accounts receivable from customers, accounts
payable to suppliers, and other short-term payables is equivalent to their book value, as these
instruments have short maturities.
• The fair value of receivables and loans with fixed or variable interest rates is assessed based on
factors such as interest rates, risk, repayment ability, and the nature of the risks associated with
the debt. Based on this assessment, the Company estimates a provision for amounts that may
not be recoverable.
fhe fair value of financial assets available for sale that are listed on the slock exchange is the
quoted transaction price at the end of the fiscal year. The fair value of unlisted financial assets
available for sale is estimated using appropriate valuation methods.
5. Events occurring after the end of the reporting period
In 2024, the price of fresh cassava increased significantly (over 40% compared to the same
period last year), which led to an increase in the production cost of cassava starch while the
selling price during the period showed a downward trend. This factor negatively impacted the
business results, causing a significant decrease in profit compared to the same period last year.
I lowcver. with the sharp decrease in the price of fresh cassava during the period (36% compared
to the same period last year), the production cost of cassava starch decreased. In addition, the
Company's Board of Directors is actively seeking solutions to boost inventory sales while
controlling input costs, ensuring profitability for the Company in the next fiscal year.
Apart from the events mentioned above, the Company's Board of Directors affirms that there arc
no other events occurring up to the date of preparing this report that have not been considered for
adjusting the figures or disclosed in the interim consolidated financial statements.
