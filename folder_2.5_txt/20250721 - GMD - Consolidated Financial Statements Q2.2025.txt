is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an economic activity and exists only when the
strategic financial and operating decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous consent of
the parties sharing control (the ventures).
The Group recognizes its interests in jointly-controlled entities in accordance with the equity method.
Accordingly, contributed capital in joint ventures is initially recognized at original cost and then
adjusted for the changes in the Group’s ownership rate of net assets of jointly-controlled entities. The
consolidated Income Statement reflects the Group’s ownership in the financial performance of
jointly-controlled entities. The Group stops using the equity method from the date it ceases to have
the jointly-controlled right or significant influences on jointly-controlled entities.
The Financial Statements of the jointly controlled entity arc prepared for the fiscal period that is the
same as the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group. In the case that the accounting policy
of a jointly controlled entity is different from the accounting policy applied consistently in the Group,
the Financial Statements of that jointly controlled entity will be properly adjusted before being used
for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For the second quarter of the fiscal period ending 31 December 2025
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (cont.)
Unrealized profits/(losses) arising from transactions with jointly-controlled entities arc eliminated in
proportion to the amount under the Group’s ownership in the preparation of the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Associates
An associate is an entity which the Group has significant influence but not the control to govern the
financial and operating policies. Significant influence is the right to participate in making the
associate’s financial and operating policies but not control those policies.
Investments in associates are recorded as in the owner’s equity method. Accordingly, the investment
into associate is initially recorded at costs on the Consolidated Financial Statements and then adjusted
for the post acquisition change in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. If the Group’s share
of loss of an associate exceeds or equals the carrying amount of an investment, the investment is then
reported at nil (0) value on the Consolidated Financial Statements, except when the Group has
obligations to pay on behalf of the associate to satisfy obligations of the associate.
The Financial Statements of the associate are prepared for the accounting period that is the same as
the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group. In the case that the accounting policy of an ^
associate is different from the accounting policy applied consistently in the Group, the Financial
Statements of that associate will be properly adjusted before being used for the preparation of the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unrealized profits/(losses) arising from transactions with associates are eliminated in proportion to
the amount under the Group’s ownership in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. ^
Investments in equity instruments of other entities
Investments in equity instruments of other entities include such investments in equity instruments
that the Group does not have the control, joint control or significant influence on these entities.
Investments in equity instruments of other entities are initially recognized at original costs, including
the purchase price plus other directly attributable expenditure. Dividends and profits of the periods
prior to the purchase of investments are recorded as a decrease in value of such investments.
Dividends and profit of the periods after the purchase of investments are recorded into the sales.
Particularly, the dividends paid in the form of shares arc not recorded as an increase in values, but
the increasing quantity is followed up.
Provisions for investments in equity instruments of other entities are made as follows:
• For investments in listed shares or the reliably determined fair value of investments, provisions
are made based on the market value of shares.
• For investments of which the fair value is unable to determine at the time of reporting, provisions
are made based on the losses of the invested entities at the rate equal to the difference between
the actual capital invested by parties and the actual owner’s equity multiplying (x) by the Group’s
rate of capital contribution in comparison with the total actual capital invested by parties.
Increases/(decreascs) in the provisions for investments in equity instruments of other entities as of
the balance sheet date are recorded into “Financial expenses”.

following principles:
• Trade receivables reflect receivables concerning the commercial nature arising from purchase
and sale transactions between the Group and customers who are independent to the Group.

costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and conditions.
• Work-in-process: The item reflects the arisen expenses related to unfinished projects.
• For finished goods: Costs comprise costs of materials, direct labor and directly relevant general
manufacturing expenses allocated based on normal operations.
Stock-out costs are determined in accordance with the weighted average method and recorded in line
with the perpetual method.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventories in the ordinary course of business
less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Allowance for inventories is recognized when their costs are higher than their net realizable values.
For services in progress, allowance is recorded for each type of services with specific prices.
Increases/(decreases) in the obligatory allowance for inventories as of the balance sheet date arc

Interest expenses for container financial lease are allocated into expenses in accordance with the
straight-line method for the maximum period of 06 periods.
9. Operating leased assets
A lease is classified as an operating lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident
to ownership belonging to the lessor. The lease expenses are allocated in the Group’s operation costs
in accordance with the straight-line method over the lease term and do not depend on the method of
lease payment.
10. Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are determined by their historical costs less accumulated depreciation.
Historical costs of tangible fixed assets include all the expenses paid by the Group to bring the asset
to its working condition for its intended use. Other expenses arising subsequent to initial recognition
arc included into historical costs of fixed assets only if it can be clearly demonstrated that the
expenditure has resulted in future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of these
assets. Those which do not meet the above conditions will be recorded into operation expenses during
the period.
When a tangible fixed asset is sold or disposed, its historical cost and accumulated depreciation are
written off, then any gain or loss arising from such disposal is included in the income or the expenses
during the period.
Tangible fixed assets arc depreciated in accordance with the straight-line method over their estimated
useful lives. The depreciation periods applied arc as follows:
Fixed assets Periods
Buildings and structures 05 - 40
Machinery and equipment 05-10
Vehicles 06 - 20
Office equipment 03-10
11. Financial leased assets
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident to
ownership belonging to the lessee. Financial leased assets are determined by their historical costs
less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost is the lower cost of the fair value of the leased asset at
commencement of the lease term and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Discount
rate used to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in
the lease or else mentioned in the lease. If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined,
the incremental borrowing rate at commencement of the lease term will be applied.
Financial leased assets are depreciated in accordance with the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives. If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the
end of the lease, the fixed asset shall be depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the
estimated useful life of the asset. The maximum depreciation periods of vehicles are 06 periods.
12. Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are determined by their initial costs less accumulated amortization.
Initial costs of intangible fixed assets include all the costs paid by the Group to bring the asset to its
working condition for its intended use. Other costs relevant to intangible fixed assets arising
subsequent to initial recognition are included into operation costs during the period only if these
costs arc associated with a specific intangible fixed asset and result in future economic benefits
expected to be obtained from the use of these assets.

Land use right
Land use right includes all the actual expenses paid by the Corporation directly related to the land
being used such as expenses to obtain the land use right, compensation for house removal, land
clearance and ground leveling, registration fees, etc. The land use right is permanent, so it is not

assumed liabilities as well as the equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of
the acquiree, plus any cost directly attributable to the business combination. The acquired assets, the

fair values as at the acquisition date.
If the business combination covers some accounting periods, the cost of business combination equals
the total investment made at the date of obtaining the control of subsidiaries plus the amount of
previous investments which are re-evaluated at fair value as at the date of obtaining the control of
subsidiaries. The difference between the re-evaluated amount and the cost of investment shall be
recorded in the financial performance provided that the Group does not have any significant influence
on subsidiaries prior the date of obtaining the control and the investment in subsidiaries is presented
in line with the cost method. In case where the Group has significant influence on the subsidiaries
prior the date of obtaining the control the investment in subsidiaries is presented in line with the
equity method, the difference between the re-evaluated amount and the cost of investment
determined in line with the equity method shall be recorded in the financial performance; and the
difference between the investment determined in line with the equity method and the cost of
investment shall be directly recorded in “Retained earnings” of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the second quarter of the fiscal period ending 31 December 2025
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (cont.)
The excess of the cost of business combination over the ownership share of the Group in the net fair
value of the assets, the identifiable and contingent liabilities of acquiree which are recognized at the
date obtaining the control of subsidiaries is recognized as goodwill. If the ownership share of the
Group in the net fair value of the assets, the identifiable and contingent liabilities of acquiree which
arc recognized at the date of obtaining the control of subsidiaries exceeds the cost of business
combination, the difference will be included in the financial performance.
The goodwill is allocated according the straight-line method in 10 periods. When there is evidence
that goodwill loss is more than the allocated amount, the allocated amount during the period is the
loss incurred.
The benefit of non-controlling shareholders as at the date of business combination is initially
measured based on the ownership share of non-controlling shareholders in the fair values of the
assets, the liabilities and the inherent liabilities recognized.
15. Payables and accrued expenses
Payables and accrued expenses are recorded for the amounts payable in the future associated with
the goods and services already received. Accrued expenses are recorded based on reasonable y

on the following principles: ¿>
• Trade payables reflect payables of commercial nature arising from the purchase of goods,
services, or assets, of which the seller is an independent entity with the Group.
• Accrued expenses reflect expenses for goods, services received from suppliers or supplied to
customers but have not been paid, invoiced or lack of accounting records and supporting
documents; pay on leave payable to employees; and accrual of operation expenses.
• Other payables reflect payables of non-commercial nature and irrelevant to purchase, sales of
goods or provisions of services.
The payables and accrued expenses are classified as short-term and long-term items in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet based on their remaining term as of the balance sheet date.
16. Provisions for payables
Provisions are recorded when the Group has present obligations (legal or constructive) as a result of
a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required
to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If time causes material effects, the provisions will be determined by deducting the amount to be spent
in future to settle the liability at the pre-tax discount rate that reflects the assessments of the time
value of money and the specific risks from this liability in the current market. The increase in
provisions due to the effect of time will be recognized as a financial expense.
Provisions payable of the Group is related to compensation for damages during transport.
17. Owner’s equity

financial instruments and other non-cash items.
Dividends are recorded as payables upon approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders.
19. Recognition of sales and income

period.
• If trade discounts, sales allowances incur after the release of the Consolidated Financial
Statements, revenues are derecognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the
following period.
21. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are interests and other costs that the Group directly incurs in connection with the
borrowing.
Borrowing costs arc recorded as an expense when it is incurred. In case the borrowing costs arc
directly attributable to the construction or the production of an asset in progress, which takes a
substantial period of time (over 12 months) to get ready for intended use or sales of the asset, these
costs will be included in the cost of that asset. To the extent that the borrowings are especially for
the purpose of construction of fixed assets and investment properties, the borrowing cost is eligible
for capitalization even if construction period is under 12 months. Incomes arisen from provisional ;
investments as loans are recognized as a decrease in the costs of relevant assets.
In the event that general borrowings arc partly used for the acquisition, construction or production
of an asset in progress, the costs eligible for capitalization will be determined by applying the (
capitalization rate to average accumulated expenditure on construction or production of that asset. r
The capitalization rate is computed at the weighted average interest rate of the borrowings not yet
paid during the period, except for particular borrowings serving the purpose of obtaining a specific
asset.
22. Expenses
Expenses arc those that result in outflows of the economic benefits and arc recorded at the time of
transactions or when incurrence of the transaction is reliable regardless of whether payment for
expenses is made or not.
Expenses and their corresponding revenues are simultaneously recognized in accordance with the
matching principle. In the event that matching principle conflicts with the prudence principle,
expenses are recognized based on the nature and regulations of accounting standards in order to
guarantee that transactions can be fairly and truly reflected.
23. Corporate income tax
Corporate income tax includes current income tax and deferred income tax.
Current income tax
Current income tax is the tax amount computed based on the taxable income. Taxable income is
different from accounting profit due to the adjustments of temporary differences between tax and
accounting figures, non-deductible expenses as well as those of non-taxable income and losses
brought forward.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is the amount of corporate income tax payable or refundable due to temporary
differences between book values of assets and liabilities serving the preparation of the Financial
Statements and the values for tax purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all the
temporary taxable differences. Deferred income tax assets are recorded only when there is an
assurance on the availability of taxable income in the future against which the temporarily deductible
differences can be used.
Carrying values of deferred corporate income tax assets are considered as of the balance sheet date
and will be reduced to the rate that ensures enough taxable income against which the benefits from

there is certainly enough taxable income to use these unrecognized deferred corporate income tax
assets.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are determined at the estimated rate to
be applied in the period when the assets are recovered, or the liabilities arc settled based on the
effective tax rates as of the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is recognized in the Income
Statement. In the case that deferred income tax is related to the items of the owner’s equity, corporate
income tax will be included in the owner’s equity.
The Group shall offset deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if:
• The Group has the legal right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax
liabilities; and
• Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are relevant to corporate income
tax which is under the management of one tax authority either:
Of the same subject to corporate income tax; or
