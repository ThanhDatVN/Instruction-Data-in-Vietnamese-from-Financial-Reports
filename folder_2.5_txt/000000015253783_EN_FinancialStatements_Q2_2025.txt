1. Basis of preparation
The financial statements are presented on the basis of historical cost.
2. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, cash in banks and short-term, highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of not more than three months that are readily convertible
into known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
3. Investments
Held-for-trading securities and investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint business ventures
are recorded by their historical cost.
Allowance for decline in value of trading securities are recorded for each type of securities
traded in the market that has a market price lower than to the book price. Provision for
diminution in value of the investments to other financial institutions are made when the financial
institutions incur losses (except in cases of planned losses that have been predetermined in the
business plan prior to investment) with the appropriate amount according to the percentage of
ownership in those financial institutions.
When liquidating an investment, the difference between the net liquidation value and the book
value is recognized as income or expense in the period.
4. Receivables
Trade receivables and other receivables are recognized based on invoices and documents.
Provisions for bad debts are established based on the assessment of the recoverability of each
debt.
5. Inventories
Inventories are measured at their historical costs. The cost of inventories comprises costs of
purchase, costs of conversion and other directly related cost incurred in bringing the inventories
to their present location and condition.The historical cost of inventory is calculated using the weighted average basis and is recorded
using the periodic method.
Provision for inventories are recognized when the original cost exceeds the net realizable value.
The net realizable value is the estimated selling price of the inventory less the estimated costs to
complete the product and the estimated costs necessary to sell them.
6. Fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of a tangible fixed
asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the tangible
fixed asset to working condition for its intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing
the asset and restoring the site on which it is located, if any. Expenditures for additions,
improvements and renewals are added to the carrying amount of the assets and expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to the separate income statement as incurred.
When tangible fixed assets are sold or retired, any gain or loss resulting from their disposal (the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount) is included in the separate
income statement.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets are calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of each asset as follows:
Fixed Assets Years
Buildings and structures 7-50
Machinery and equipment 5-10
Means of transportation 6-10
Office equipment 3-7
Others 5-7
Intangible Fixed Assets
Licogi brand value

Construction and Infrastructure Development Corporation. The brand value of Licogi will be
amortised over 10 years.
7. Deferred taxDeferred tax are calculated by temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax
base and accounting base of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all
temporary differences, while deferred tax assets are only recognized when it is probable that
taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the

during the period, excluding specific loans intended for the purpose of forming a specific asset.
11. Accruals
Accruals are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future to ensure that the actual expenses do
not cause spikes in production and business expenses based on the principle of matching revenue
and expenses. When those expenses are incurred, if there is a discrepancy with the accruedamount, the accountant will make additional entries or reduce the expenses corresponding to the
amount of the discrepancy.
12. Provisions

present obligation at the balance sheet date.

offsetting the increase and decrease, the remaining difference is recorded in financial revenue or
financial expenses in the period.All foreign exchange differences from translating monetary balances at balance sheet date are
offset against each other before recording to finance income or finance expenses.

of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually upon the delivery of the goods and no significant
uncertainties remain regarding the payment of consideration, associated costs or the possible
return of goods.
When providing services, revenue is recognized when there are no significant uncertainties
regarding the payment of consideration or associated costs. In case the service is performed over

calculate the cost of goods sold for the completed real estate portion, which is determined to be
sold during the period and meets the criteria for revenue recognition. The accrued expenses
