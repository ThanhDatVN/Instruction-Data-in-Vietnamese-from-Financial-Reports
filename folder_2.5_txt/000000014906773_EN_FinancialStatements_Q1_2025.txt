IV. APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1. Basis of consolidation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of CNT Group Corporation (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries
(collectively referred to as the “Group”) for the financial year ended December 31, 2024.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and until the date that such
control ceases.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
Adjustments are made to eliminate any differences in accounting policies to ensure consistency across the Group.
All balances between entities within the Group, as well as revenues, income, and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, including unrealised
gains from such transactions that are included in the carrying amounts of assets, are fully eliminated.
Unrealised losses arising from intra-group transactions that are included in the carrying amounts of assets are also eliminated, except to the extent
that the transaction indicates an impairment of the related asset.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented separately in the consolidated
income statement and within equity in the consolidated balance sheet
Losses incurred by subsidiaries are allocated to non-controlling interests even if such losses exceed the non-controlling interests' share in the net
assets of the subsidiaries.
Goodwill (or gain from a bargain purchase) arising from the acquisition of subsidiaries represents the difference between the cost of the investment
and the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiaries at the acquisition date. Goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over its
estimated usefi.il life, not exceeding 10 years. The Group periodically assesses goodwill for impairment, and if there is evidence that the impairment
loss exceeds the annual amortisation amount, the excess impairment is recognised immediately in the period in which it arises.
2. Principle for cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand, demand deposit.
Cash equivalents comprise term deposits and other short-term investments with maturity period less than 3 months from the date of acquisition,
highly liquid, readily convertible to known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in cash.
3. Cash includes cash on hand, demand deposit.
Held-to-maturity investments
Hcld-to-maturity investments include term deposits at banks, loans held to maturity to earn periodic interest, and other investments held to maturity.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognised at cost, which includes the purchase price and any directly attributable transaction costs. After
initial recognition, if no provision for doubtful debts is made in accordance with legal regulations, these investments are measured at recoverable
value. When there is clear evidence that part or all of an investment is irrecoverable, the corresponding loss is recognised in finance expenses for the
period and deducted from the carrying amount of the investment.
Loans receivable
Loans and receivables are amounts lent under loan agreements, arrangements, or contracts between two parties for the purpose of earning periodic
interest and arc recognized at cost, net of the provision for doubtful receivables. The Provision for doubtful receivables on loans is determined based
on estimated losses for overdue amounts and those not yet overdue but deemed uncollectible due to the borrower's inability to repay.
Investments in associates
Investments in associates are recognised when the Group holds from 20% to less than 50% of the voting rights of the investees, has significant
influence, but does not have control over the financial and operating policy decisions of these investees. Investments in associates are presented in the
consolidated financial statements using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the
net assets of the associates. The consolidated statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associates after
the acquisition date as a separate line item.
Goodwill arising on acquisition of the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill is not amortised and subject to
annual review for impairment.
The financial statements of associates are prepared for the same reporting period as the consolidated financial statements of the Group and using
consistent accounting policies. Appropriate consolidation adjustments have been made to ensure the accounting policies are applied consistently with
those of the Group where necessary.
Principles for recording equity investments in other entities
Equity investment in other entities represents the Group's investment in other entities' equity instruments. However, the Group does not hold any
control or joint control right and exercise significant influences over the investees either
The investments are stated at original cost including purchase price and costs directly attributable to the investment.

provision for loss will be made as follows:
+ Investments in listed equity or securities measured at fair value with reliably determinable fair values, the provision is recognized based on the
market value of the securities.
+ If it is impossible to determine the investments' fair value at the reporting date, the provision will be made on the basis the loss that investee
suflers. Basis for making provision for loss of investments in other entities is the consolidated financial statements of the investee (if it is a parent
company) or the financial statements of the investee (if it is an independent entity without subsidiaries).

Receivables are recognized at cost, net of provision for doubtful receivables.
The classifying of the receivables as trade receivables, inter-company receivables and other receivables depends on the nature of the transaction or
relationship between the company and debtor.

debtors who go bankrupey, making procedures for dissolution, go missing or run away...

than their cost, is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated selling expenses. Provision for obsolete
inventories is determined as the excess of the cost of inventories over their net realizable value. Provisions are made for each inventory item where
the cost exceeds its NRV.
6. Principles for recording fixed assets:
6.1 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. The initial cost of a tangible fixed asset comprises all expenditures of
bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. The expenditures incurred beyond their originally assessed standard of
performance are capitalised as an additional cost of tangible fixed assets when they have resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits
expected to be obtained from the use of those tangible fixed assets. The expenditures which do not meet the above conditions are charged to the
expenses in the year.

(excluding taxes to be refunded) and relevant expenses calculated to the time when such fixed assets are put into operation such as fees for
installation and trial operation of fixed assets; specialists and other direct costs.

as an intangible fixed asset.

13. Objectives and financial risks management policies
Major risks of financial instruments include market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board of Management considers the application of management policies for the above risks as follows:
13.1. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to the changes in market prices. There are
three market risks: interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other price risks, for example risk of stock price. Financial instruments affected by the
market risks include: borrowings, liabilities and deposits.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the
proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
Wlren calculating the sensibility analysis, the Board of Management assumes that the sensibility of available-for-sale liability in the balance sheet
and related items in the income statement is affected by changes in the assumption of corresponding market risks. This analysis is based on the
financial assets and liabilities that the Group held as at December 31, 2024.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to the changes in market prices. Market
risks due to change in interest rate of the Group mainly relate to: trade receivables, other receivables, borrowings and liabilities, cash and short-term
deposits.
The Group manages the interest rate risk by analyzing the competition status in the market in order to apply the interest rate that brings benefits to
the Group and still in the limit of its risk management.
Sensibility to interest rate
The sensibility of borrowings and liabilities, cash and short-term deposits of the Group to changes that may occur at reasonable level in the interest
rate is illustrated as follows.
Assuming that other variables remain constant, the fluctuation in the interest rate of deposits and borrowings with floating interest rate makes impact
on the Group's profit before tax as follows:
N.2. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk due to the customers' failure to perform its obligations causing the financial loss for the Group. The Group bears credit risks
from production and doing business activities (mainly receivables from trading securities, trade receivables and other receivables) and from its
financial activities including bank deposits and other financial instruments.
Trade receivables
T he Group minimizes the credit risk by only doing business with entities who have good financial capacity and closely keeping track of the
receivables to speed up the recovery of debts. On the basis of this method and receivables related to different customers, the credit risk does not
concentrate on a certain customer.
Loan Receivables
The Group mitigates credit risk by only allowing member companies to borrow money with limits, loan durations, and borrowing purposes regulated
internally by the Group and specified in individual contracts. The Group considers the credit risk related to receivables from lending to be low.
Bank deposits
The Group mainly maintains deposits in big and prestigious banks in Vietnam. The Group assesses that the concentration level of credit exposure to
deposits is low.
15. Financial assets and financial liabilities - See page 33.
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is stated at the value that the financial instruments are convertible in present transaction
among partners, except for compulsory sale or disposal.
The Group uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value:
The fair value ofcash on hand and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other short-term liabilities is equivalent to the book
value of these items because these instruments are in short-term.
- The fair value of securities and financial investments, whose fair value cannot be reliably determined due to the absence of a highly liquid market
for these securities and financial investments, is presented at their book value.
Except for the above-mentioned items, the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities has not been evaluated and determined officially as at
December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. However, the Board ofManagement has assessed that the fair value of financial assets and liabilities is
not significantly different from the book value at the period end.
