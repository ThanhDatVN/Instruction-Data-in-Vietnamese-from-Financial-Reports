REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
To: Shareholders, Board of Directors and Board of Management
VinhPhuc Infrastructure Development Joint Stock Company
We have reviewed the accompanying Interim Separate Financial Statements of VinhPhuc Infrastructure
Development Joint Stock Company ("the Company") as prepared on April 2025 from pages 05 to 43, which
comprise the interim Balance Sheet as at 31 March 2025, the Interim Income Statement, the Interim Cash Flow

Statements. 0/
Responsibilities of the Board of Management
The Board of Management of VinhPhuc Infrastructure Development Joint Stock Company is responsible for the
preparation and fair presentation of the Interim Separate Financial Statements in accordance with Vietnamese
Accounting Standards, Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and prevailing regulations applicable to the
preparation and presentation of the Interim Separate Financial Statements and also for the internal control which
the Board of Management considers necessary for the preparation and fair presentation of the Interim Separate
Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Responsibility of the Auditor
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Interim Separate Financial Statements based on our review.
We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review Engagements No. 2410 - Review
of Interim financial information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity.
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially
less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing and consequently
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be
identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Auditor's conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Interim
Separate Financial Statements do not give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the financial position of
the Company as at 31 March 2025, and of the results of its operation and its cash flows for the period from 01
October 2024 to 31 March 2025 in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, Vietnamese Corporate
Accounting System and the statutory requirements relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Interim
separate Financial Statements.

2. Principles for accounting financial investments (continued)
Principles for accounting held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments include term deposits.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price and costs associated with the
acquisition of the investments. After initial recognition, if provisions for doubtful debts have not been made as required
by law, these investments are evaluated at their recoverable values. Wlien there is firm evidence that part or all of the
investment may not be recovered, the loss is recognized as financial expenses during the year and a decrease in the
investment value.
Principles for accounting loans \^
Loans comprise amounts under contracts, or loan agreements between two parties with the purpose of earning periodic
interest and are recognized at cost, net of any provisions for doubtful receivables. Provisions for doubtfill receivables on
loans are made based on the estimated loss value that is overdue or not overdue but may not be recoverable due to the /
insolvency of debtors.
Principles of recording financial investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates
The investments in subsidiaries are recognized when the Company holds more than 50% of voting rights and has the
power to govern the financial and operating policies in order to obtain economic benefits from the subsidiaries’ operation.
When the Company ceases to control the subsidiaries, the investment in the subsidiaries will be written down.
The investment in joint ventures is recorded when the Company holds joint control over these companies' financial and
operating policies. When the Company no longer has joint control, the investment in the joint venture is derecognized. 0 j
The investments in associates are recognized when the Company holds from 20% to less than 50% of the voting rights of
those companies and has considerable influence over their decisions on financial and operating policies.
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates are initially recognized under original cost and will not be adjusted
thereafter for changes in investors’ share of net assets of the investee. The historical cost comprises purchase cost and
directly attributable expenses to the investment. In a case where the investment is a non-monetary investment, the
investment fee is recognized under the fair value of these assets at the date of occurrence.
Provision for loss of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates is made when the investee suffers from
loss leading to possible loss of capital of investor or the value of the investments is devalued. The basis for making
provisions is based on the consolidated financial statements of the investee (if it is a parent company), and the investee's
financial statements (if it is an independent enterprise without subsidiaries).
Principles for recording equity investments in other entities
Equity investments in other entities are the investments in other entities' equity instruments but the Company has no
control or joint control or has significant influence over the investee.
The investments are stated at the cost including the purchase price and costs directly attributable to the investment. In
case of the investments in non-monetary assets, the investment fee should be recorded at the fair value of the non­
monetary assets at the date of occurrence.
Regarding the investments the Company holds for a long time (not trading securities) and has insignificant influences
over the investees, provision for the loss will be made as follows:
+ If an investment in listed shares or the fair value of the investment is determined reliably, the provision shall be made
according to the market values of the shares.
+ If it is impossible to determine the investments' fair value at the reporting date, the provision will be made based on the
loss that the investee suffers. The basis for making provision for loss of investments is the consolidated financial
statements of the investee (if it is a parent company), and the investee's financial statements (if it is an independent
enterprise without a subsidiary).

3. Principle for recording trade receivables and other receivables
Principle for recording receivables: At cost less provision for doubtful receivables.
The classification of the receivables as trade receivables, internal receivables and other receivables depends on the nature
of the transaction or relationship between the company and the debtor.
Method of making provision for doubtful receivables: Provision for doubtful debts is estimated for the loss value of the
receivables, other held-to-maturity investments similar to doubtful debts that are overdue and undue, but are likely to
become possibly irrecoverable due to insolvency of debtors who go bankruptcy, making procedures for dissolution, go
missing or run away, etc.
4. Principle of recording inventories \
Principle of recording inventories: Inventories are stated at cost less the provision for the devaluation and provision for I
obsolete or deteriorated inventories. /
Cost of inventories is determined as follows: /
- Raw materials and merchandise consists of purchase cost, transportation cost, and other costs incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. V
- Finished goods: include costs of raw materials, direct labor, and related manufacturing overhead costs, which are
allocated based on direct labor cost.
- Work-in-progress includes costs of materials, labor, asset depreciation, and other expenses incurred during the
production and business process.
Method of calculating value of inventories: monthly weighted average cost.
Method of accounting for the inventories: Perpetual method z<
/1^7
Method of making provision for the devaluation of inventories: Provision for the devaluation of inventories is made//j7
when the net realizable value of inventories is lower than their original cost. Net realizable value is the estimated sellingll*lp
price less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Provision for the devaluation of inventories is the^X
difference between the cost of inventories greater than their net realizable value. Provision for the devaluation of
inventories is made for each inventory with the cost greater than the net realizable value.
5. Principles for recording and depreciating fixed assets
5.1 Principles for recording tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at the original cost less accumulated depreciation. The original cost of a tangible fixed
L asset comprises all expenditures of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. The
expenses incurred after innial recognition are capitalized when they have resulted in an increase in the future economic
benefits from the use of those tangible fixed assets. The expenses which do not meet the above conditions are expensed in
the period.
When the assets are sold or disposed of, their original costs and the accumulated depreciation which have been written
off, and any gain or loss from the disposal of assets are recorded as income or expense during the period.
D Determination of original cost in each case:
Tangible fixed assets purchased
The original cost of purchased tangible fixed assets shall consist of the actual purchase price (less trade discounts or
reduction) plus taxes (excluding taxes to be refunded) and relevant expenses calculated to the time when such fixed assets
are put into operation such as fees for installation and trial operation of fixed assets; specialists and other direct costs.
The original cost of a tangible fixed asset formed from capital construction under the mode of tendering shall be the
finalization price of the construction project, other relevant fees plus registration fee (if any).

Tangible fixed assets constructed or produced by the Company itself:
The original cost of a tangible fixed asset that is constructed or produced by the Company itself shall include the actual
production cost of the fixed asset plus expenses for installation and trial operation. In the case where the Company
transfers its self-produced products to fixed assets, the original costs will be the production costs plus other relevant
expenses calculated to the time when such fixed asset is put into operation. In such cases, all internal gains will not be
recorded in the original costs of those fixed assets.
5.2 Method of depreciating fixed assets
Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Useful life means the duration in
which the tangible fixed assets produce their effect on production and business.
The estimated useful life of an asset is as follows:
Building and structures 6-35 years
Machinery and equipment 6-8 years
Means of transportation 7 -10 years

borrowings involving consti-uction investment purposes or the production of an unfinished asset, the amount of borrowing
costs eligible for capitalization in each accounting period is determined based on the capitalization rate for the weighted
j
average accumulated costs incurred for the construction investment or production of that asset. The capitalization rate is

separate financial statements and consolidated financial statements, it must present information on earnings per share in yfr

financial statement.
12. Financial risk management policies and objectives
The risks from financial instruments include market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board of Management considers the application of management policies for the above risks as follows:
12.1 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in
market prices. There are three market risks: interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other price risks, for example,
risk of stock price. Financial instruments affected by the market risks include borrowings and liabilities, deposits, and
available-for-sale investments.
The following sensitivity analysis relates to the financial position of the Company as at 30 September 2024 and 31 March
2025.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest
rates of the debt and the proportion of the financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
When calculating the sensibility analysis, the Board of Management assumes that the sensibility of available-for-sale
liability in the balance sheet and related items in the income statement is affected by changes in the assumption of
corresponding market risks. This analysis is based on the financial assets and liabilities that the Company held at 30
September 2024 and 31 March 2025.

12. Financial risk management policies and objectives (continued)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes
in market prices. Market risks due to change in the interest rate of the Company mainly relate to the borrowings and
