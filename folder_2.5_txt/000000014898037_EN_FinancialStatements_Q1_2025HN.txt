transactions are also eliminated unless the costs creating such losses are irrecoverable.

following principles:
♦ If the discount, trade discount, or return arises before the issuance of the Interim Consolidated

acquisition, construction or production of assets that take a substantial period of time to complete
and put into use or sale are added to the cost of the asset until such time as the asset is put into use
or sale. Income from temporary investment in loans is recorded as a reduction in the cost of the
relevant asset. For loans specifically for the construction of fixed assets or investment real estate,
interest is capitalized even if the construction period is less than 12 months.
In case of joint capital borrowings, which are used for the purpose of investment in construction or
production of an uncompleted asset, the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization in each
accounting period shall be determined according to the capitalization rate for weighted average
accumulated costs incurred to the investment in construction or production of such asset. The
capitalization rate shall be calculated according to the weighted average interest rate applicable to
the enterprise’s bon'owings unrepaid in the period, except for particular borrowings for purpose of
obtaining an uncompleted asset.
20. Expenses

Credit risk is the risk that a party to a financial instrument or customer contract will not meet its
obligations, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating
activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including bank deposits.
Trade and other receivables
The Company manages credit risk by regularly monitoring outstanding receivables and seeking to
maintain close control over outstanding receivables at the reporting date.
Bank deposits
The Company mainly maintains deposit balances with well-known banks in Vietnam. Credit risk for
deposit balances with banks is managed by the Company's treasury department in accordance with the
Company's policy. The Company's maximum credit risk for items in the balance sheet at each financial
reporting period is the carrying amount as presented in Note 3. The Company considers that the
concentration of credit risk for bank deposits is low.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will have difficulty in fillfilling its financial obligations due to
lack of capital, The Company's liquidity risk arises mainly from the fact that financial assets and financial
liabilities have different maturities.
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining a level of cash and cash equivalents and bank loans
at a level that the Board of Directors considers adequate to meet the Company's operations and to
minimize the impact of fluctuations in cash flows.
