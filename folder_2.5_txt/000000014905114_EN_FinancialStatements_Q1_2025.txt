Standards and the Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting System, as issued and currently in effect, have
been fully complied with in the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements for the period from January 1, 2025 to March 31, 2025.
Basis of preparation of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements combine the financial statements of the Company
and the financial statements of the companies controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) prepared
based on the application of Circular No. 202/2014/TT-BTC dated December 22, 2014, issued by the
Ministry of Finance. This control is achieved when the Coporation is able to control the financial
and operating policies of the investee companies in order to derive benefits from their operations.
The operation results of subsidiaries that were purchased or sold in the financial year are presented
in the Corporate’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements from the day they were purchased to
the day the investment in those subsidiaries was sold.
In case of necessity, the Financial Statements of the Subsidiaries are adjusted so that the accounting
policies applied at the Corporation and other subsidiaries are the same.
All inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from
the Corporation’s equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests
at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling interests’ share of changes
in equity since the date of the combination. Losses corresponding to the interests of non-controlling
shareholders that exceed their share of the total equity of the subsidiary are deducted from the
interests of the Company, unless the non-controlling shareholders have a binding obligation and the
ability to compensate forthose losses.
Business consolidation
The assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of the Subsidiary are determined at their fair values
at the date of acquisition of the Subsidiary. Any additional amount between the purchase price and
the total fair value of the acquired asset is recognized as business advantage. Any deficit between
the purchase price and the total fair value of the acquired asset is recognized in the consolidated
income statement of the accounting period in which the acquisition of the subsidiary occurred.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Corporation’s interest in the net
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate, or
jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognized as an asset and is amortized
over its estimated useful life of 10 years.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate, or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of
unamortized goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

costs, direct labor costs, and manufacturing overhead, if any, incurred to bring the inventory to its
current location and condition. Net realizable value is determined as the estimated selling price less

NOTE TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ( CONTINUED)
4. SUMMARY OF SINGIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ( CONTINUED)
Financial lease as lessee (Continued)
The company is the lessee.
The company recognizes leased assets under finance leases as its assets at the fair value of the leased
asset at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is recorded on the Balance Sheet as a finance lease liability.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs and the reduction of the lease liability to
ensure a constant periodic interest rate on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance costs are
recognized in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to the leased asset, in which case
they are capitalized in accordance with the company’s policy on borrowing costs (see further details
below). Operating lease payments are recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the
lease term. Any amounts received or receivable to incentivize signing the operating lease are also
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Investment Properties
Investment properties include land use rights and buildings, structures held by the Corporation for the
purpose of earning rentals or awaiting higher price, which is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The historical cost of investment property includes all expenses (cash and cash equivalents) paid by
the Company, or the fair value of other amount exchanged to acquire the investment property by the
time of purchase or construction of the investment property.
Subsequent expenditure relating to an investment property that has already been recognized should be
added to the net-book value of the investment property when it is probable that future economic
benefits in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing investment
property will flow to the enterprise and an increase in the cost of the investment property shall be
recorded.
Depreciation: Investment properties for rental are depreciated using the straight-line method to
gradually deduct the asset's original value over its estimated useful life. The company does not
depreciate investment properties that are held for capital appreciation.
Construction in Progress
Assets under construction for production, leasing, management, or any other purposes are recorded
at cost. This cost includes related service expenses and interest expenses in accordance with the
Corporation's accounting policies. Depreciation of these assets is applied similarly to other assets,
starting from when the asset is in a state of readiness for use.
Repair Expenses
Prepaid expenses reflect actual costs that have been incurred but are related to the results of business
operations over multiple accounting periods. These expenses are then allocated to the cost of
production or business operations in subsequent accounting periods.
Prepaid expenses are recorded at their historical cost and classified as either current or non-current
assets on the balance sheet, depending on the duration of the prepaid contract.
Payables
The account payables are monitored in detail by payable terms, payable parties, original currency,
and other factors depending on the Corporation’s management requirement.
