IV. ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED
1. Basis for preparing financial statements
Financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting (except for information
relating to cash flows).
Affiliated units form their own accounting apparatus and perform dependent accounting. The
separate financial statements of the entire Company are prepared based on the consolidation of
the financial statements of affiliates. Revenue and balances between affiliates are eliminated
when preparing the separate financial statements.
2. Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the
transaction. Balances of foreign currency items at the end of the accounting period are translated
at the exchange rate on that date.
Exchange rate differences arising during the period from foreign currency transactions are
recorded in financial income or financial expenses. Exchange rate differences arising from
revaluation of foreign currency items at the end of the accounting period after offsetting the
increase and decrease are recorded in financial income or financial expenses.
The exchange rate used to convert transactions in foreign currency is the actual exchange rate at
the time of the transaction. The actual exchange rate for transactions in foreign currency is ^
determined as follows:
• For foreign currency purchase and sale contracts (spot foreign currency purchase and sale
contracts, forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, swap contracts): exchange U
rate signed in the foreign currency purchase and sale contract between the Company and the J'O
bank- .
• For capital contributions or capital receipts: foreign currency buying rate of the bank where
the Company opens an account to receive capital from investors on the date of capital
contribution.
• For receivables: foreign currency buying rate of the commercial bank where the Company
designates the customer to make payment at the time the transaction occurs.
• For payables: cross exchange rate of Vietnamese Dong against some foreign currencies
applied for calculating export tax and import tax aimounced by the State Bank.
• For asset purchases or expenses paid immediately in foreign currency (not through payable
accounts): foreign currency buying rate of the commercial bank where the Company makes
payment.
The exchange rate used to re-evaluate the balance of foreign currency monetary items at the end
of the accounting period is determined according to the following principles:
• For foreign currency deposits at banks: foreign currency buying rate of the bank where the
Company opens a foreign currency account.
• For foreign currency monetary items classified as other assets: foreign currency buying rate
of Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade (the Bank with which the
Company regularly transacts).
• For foreign currency items classified as liabilities: cross exchange rates of Vietnamese Dong
against a number of foreign currencies applied to calculate export and import taxes
announced by the State Bank.

3. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term investments with a
maturity of no more than 03 months from the date of investment, which can be easily converted
into a known amount ofcash and are subject to no risk of change in value at the reporting date.
4. Financial investments
Held to maturity investments
Investments are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the intention and ability to
hold them until maturity. The Company’s held-to-maturity investments consist only of term
deposits with the intention of earning periodic interest.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price
and any costs associated with the purchase of the investments. After initial recognition, these
investments are recognized at their recoverable amount. Interest income from investments held
to maturity after the acquisition date is recognized in the Income Statement on an accrual basis.
Interest earned before the Company holds the investment is deducted from the cost at the
acquisition date.
When there is strong evidence that part or all of the investment may not be recovered and the
amount of loss can be reliably determined, the loss is recorded in financial expenses, during the
period and directly deduct the investment value.
Investments in subsidiaries and associates
Subsidiary
A subsidiary is an enterprise controlled by the Company . Control is achieved when the
Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee enterprise
so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Affiliated companies
An associate is an enterprise in which the Company has significant influence but not control
over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is the power to participate in the
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not control over those policies.
Initial notes
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are initially recorded at cost, including the purchase
price or capital contribution plus costs directly related to the investment. In case of investment
in non-monetary assets, the cost of the investment is recorded at the fair value of the non­
monetary assets at the time of occurrence .
Dividends from periods prior to the investment being purchased are recorded as a reduction in
the value of the investment itself. Dividends from periods subsequent to the investment being
purchased are recorded as revenue. Dividends received in the form of shares are only recorded
as the number of shares increased, not the value of the shares received.
Provision for losses on investments in subsidiaries and associates
Provision for losses on investments in subsidiaries and associates is made when the subsidiary
or associate suffers a loss, with the provision equal to the difference between the actual
investment capital of the parties in the subsidiary or associate and the actual equity multiplied by
the Company’s actual contributed charter capital ownership ratio in the subsidiary or associate.
If the subsidiary or associate is the subject of the Consolidated Financial Statement, the basis for
determining the provision for losses is the Consolidated Financial Statement.

must be set up at the end of the accounting period is recorded in financial expenses.
Investments in equity instruments of other entities
Investments in equity instruments of other entities include investments in equity instruments but
the Company does not have control, joint control or significant influence over the investee.
Investments in equity instruments of other entities are initially recorded at cost, including the
purchase price or capital contribution plus direct costs related to the investment. Dividends from
periods before the investment is purchased are recorded as a reduction in the value of that
investment. Dividends from periods after the investment is purchased are recorded as revenue.
Dividends received in shares are only recorded as the number of shares increased, not the value
of the shares received.
Provision for losses on investments in equity instruments of other entities is made as follows:
• For investments in listed shares or for which the fair value of the investment is reliably
determined, the provision is based on the market value of the shares.
• For investments whose fair value cannot be determined at the reporting date, provisions are
made based on the loss of the investee with the provision equal to the difference between the
actual investment capital of the owners and the equity at the end of the accounting period
multiplied by the ratio of the Company's charter capital to the total contributed charter
capital at other entities.
Increases and decreases in the provision for investment losses in equity instruments of other
entities that need to be set up at the end of the accounting period are recorded in financial
expenses.
5. Accounts Receivable -,
Accounts receivable are stated at carrying amount less allowance for doubtful debts.
The classification of receivables as trade receivables and other receivables is carried out
according to the following principles :
• Trade receivables reflect commercial receivables arising from purchase and sale transactions
between the Company and buyers who are independent entities of the Company .
• Other receivables reflect non-commercial receivables not related to purchase and sale
transactions.
Provision for doubtful debts is made for each doubtful debt based on the estimated loss that may
occur.
Increases and decreases in the balance of the provision for doubtful debts that must be set up at
the end of the accounting period are recorded in business administration expenses.

• Finished goods: includes the cost of raw materials, direct labor and directly related general
manufacturing costs allocated based on normal levels of activity.
The cost of goods sold is calculated using the weighted average method and is accounted for
using the perpetual inventory method.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventories in the ordinary course of
business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the
sale.
Provision for inventory devaluation is established for each inventory item whose original cost is
greater than its net realizable value. For unfinished services, provision for devaluation is
calculated for each type of service with a separate price. Increases and decreases in the balance
of provision for devaluation of inventory that must be established at the end of the accounting
period are recorded in cost of goods sold.
7. Prepaid expenses
Prepaid expenses include actual expenses that have been incurred but are related to the business
performance of many accounting periods. The Company's prepaid expenses mainly consist of
fixed asset repair costs and replacement and installation costs for customers’ meters. These
prepaid expenses are amortized over the period for which they are paid or the period in which
economic benefits are generated from them.
Fixed asset repair costs
One-time repair costs of fixed assets of large value are allocated to expenses by die straight-line
method with an allocation period of no more than 03 years.
Cost of replacing and installing clocks for customers

straight-line method over a period of 03 years.
8. Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of tangible fixed
assets includes all costs incurred by the Company to acquire the fixed assets up to the time the
assets are ready for use. Expenses incurred after initial recognition are only recorded as an
increase in the cost of fixed assets if it is certain that these costs will increase future economic
benefits from the use of the assets. Expenses incurred that do not satisfy the above conditions
are recorded as production and business expenses in the period.
When tangible fixed assets are sold or disposed of, their cost and accumulated depreciation are
eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is recognized as
income or expense in the period.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives. The depreciation years for various types of tangible fixed assets are as follows:
Type of fixed asset No. 5
Houses, buildings 05 - 50
Machinery and equipment 03 - 20
Means of transport, transmission 05-30

9. Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of intangible fixed assets includes all costs incurred by the Company to acquire the
fixed assets up to the time the asset is ready for use. Expenses related to intangible fixed assets
incurred after initial recognition are recognized as production and business expenses in the
period, unless these expenses are associated with a specific intangible fixed asset and increase
the economic benefits from these assets.
When intangible fixed assets are sold or disposed of, their cost and accumulated depreciation are
eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is recognized as
income or expense in the period.
The Company’s intangible fixed assets include:

services received. Accruals are recognized based on reasonable estimates of the amounts to be

provided to buyers but not yet paid due to lack of invoices or insufficient accounting records

Notes to separate financial statements (Cont)
Liabilities and accrued expenses are classified as short-term and long-term in the separate
balance sheet based on their remaining term at the end of the accounting period.
12. Provisions for payables
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as
a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.
If the effect of the passage of time is material, provisions are detennined by discounting the
expected future cash outflows required to settle the obligation at a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance
expense.
The Company's provisions for payables only include periodic repair and maintenance costs of
fixed assets. The provision for periodic repair and maintenance of fixed assets is based on the
fixed asset repair and maintenance plan. If the actual repair and maintenance cost of fixed assets
is higher than the provisioned amount, the difference is fully accounted for in the cost If the
actual repair and maintenance cost of fixed assets is less than the provisioned amount, the
difference is accounted for as a reduction in cost.
13. Equity
Owner's equity
Owner’s equity is recorded according to the actual capital contributed by shareholders.
Capital surplus
Share capital surplus is recorded as the difference between the issue price and the par value of
shares when first issued or additional issued, the difference between the reissue price and the
book value of treasury shares and the equity component of convertible bonds at maturity. Direct
costs related to the additional issuance of shares and reissue of treasury shares are recorded as a
decrease in share capital surplus.
14. Profit distribution
Profit after corporate income tax is distributed to shareholders after setting aside funds according
to the Company's Charter as well as legal regulations and approved by the General Meeting of
Shareholders.
The distribution of profits to shareholders takes into account non-monetary items in
undistributed profits after tax that may affect cash flow and the ability to pay dividends such as
interest on revaluation of contributed assets, interest on revaluation of monetary items, financial
instruments and other non-monetary items.
Dividends are recognized as liabilities when approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders
and when there is a notice of dividend payment from the Board of Directors.
15. Revenue and income recognition

• The Company no longer holds the right to manage the goods or products as the owner of the
goods or products or the right to control tlie goods or products.
• Revenue is determined with relative certainty. When the contract stipulates that the buyer
has the right to return the purchased products or goods under specific conditions, revenue is
only recognized when those specific conditions no longer exist and the buyer is not entitled
to return the goods or products (except in cases where the customer has the right to return
the goods or products in the form of exchange for other goods or services).
• The Company has or will obtain economic benefits from the sale transaction.
• Identify the costs associated with a sales transaction.
Service revenue
Revenue from providing services is recognized when all of the following conditions are
simultaneously satisfied:
• Revenue is measured reliably. When a contract provides that the buyer has the right to return
the services purchased under specific conditions, revenue is recognized only when those
specific conditions no longer exist and the buyer has no right to return the services provided.
• The Company has or will obtain economic benefits from the transaction of providing that
service.
• Identify the portion of work completed at the time of reporting. ÿ \<'
• Identify the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction to n^l Ct
provide that service. if , Cf
In case the service is performed over several periods, the revenue recorded in the period is based f
on the results of the work completed at the end of the accounting period.
Dividends distributed
Dividends are recorded when the Company has the right to receive dividends from capital \
contributions. Dividends received in shares are only tracked by the number of shares increased ,
not the value of shares received. y
Interest
Interest is recognized on the basis of time and the actual interest rate each period.
16. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs include interest and other costs incurred in connection with borrowing.
Borrowing costs are recognized as expenses when incurred. Where borrowing costs are directly
attributable to the construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial period of time
(over 12 months) to get ready for its intended use or sale, these borrowing costs are included in
the cost of that asset. For loans specifically used to construct fixed assets or investment
properties, interest is capitalized even if the construction period is less than 12 months. Income
from temporary investment of loans is recorded as a reduction in the cost of the relevant asset.
For general borrowings used for the purpose of investment in construction or production of
unfinished assets, the capitalized borrowing costs are determined according to the capitalization
rate for the weighted average cumulative costs incurred for investment in basic construction or
production of that asset. The capitalization rate is calculated according to the weighted average
interest rate of the outstanding boiTOwings during the period, except for separate borrowings
serving the purpose of forming a specific asset.

17. Expenses
Expenses are amounts that reduce economic benefits and are recognized at the time the
transaction occurs or when it is relatively certain that they will arise in the future, regardless of
whether money has been spent or not.
Expenses and revenues generated by them must be recorded simultaneously according to the
matching principle. In case the matching principle conflicts with the prudence principle,
expenses are recorded based on the nature and provisions of accounting standards to ensure that
transactions are reflected honestly and reasonably.
18. Corporate income tax
Corporate income tax expense includes current income tax and deferred income tax.
Current income tax
Current income tax is the tax that is calculated on taxable income. Taxable income differs from
accounting profit due to adjustments for temporary differences between tax and accounting, non­
deductible expenses as well as adjustments for non-taxable income and losses carried forward.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is the income tax payable or recoverable in respect of temporary
differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and their tax basis. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary
differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognised only when it is probable that future
taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be
utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available
to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Previously unrecognised deferred tax
assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognised to the extent that it is
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the unrecognised deferred tax
assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
year when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted at
the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised in the income statement and, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, is dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when:
• The Company has a legal right to set off current income tax assets against current income
tax liabilities; and
• These deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the
same tax authority:
- For the same taxable entity; or
- The Company intends to settle its current income tax liabilities and current income tax
assets on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in
each future period in which significant amounts of deferred income tax liabilities or
deferred income tax assets are expected to be settled or realised.
19. Related parties
Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control the other party or
exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions.

financial statements
Reasons for fluctuations in profit after CIT of separate financial statements:
1. Total revenue and other income in the Quarter II of 2025 reached VND
305,861,620,785, decreased by VND 46,465,791,013 compared to revenue and other
income in the same period of 2024 (reaching VND 352,327,411,798), corresponding to
a decrease of -13.19%.

TOTAL 305,861,620,785 352,327,411,798 -46,465,791,013 -13.19%
The main reason is that financial revenue decreased by VND 47,469,670,754,
equivalent to a decrease of -83.86%, due to the previous year's exchange rate
difference profit arising from evaluating the outstanding loan balance in foreign
currency, however it did not arise this year.
12. Total expenses in the Quarter II of 2025 reached VND 271,067,13 8,05 8,
compared to the same period in 2024, it was VND 221,632,934,156, an increase of

TOTAL 271,067,138,058 221,632,934,156 49,434,203,902 22.30%
The main reason is that financial expenses increased by VND 44,724,783,263,
equivalent to an increase of 442.45%, due to this year's exchange rate difference loss
in evaluating foreign currency loan balances.
The combination of the above effects has decreased the profit after CIT in the
Quarter II of 2025 by VND 85,721,303,850 compared to the same period in 2024,
equivalent to a decrease of -73.27%.
Reasons for fluctuations in profit after CIT of the consolidated financial

difference profit arising from the evaluation of foreign currency loan balances,
however this year it did not arise at the Parent Company.

reached VND 309,937,007,372, compared to the same period in 2024, which was

TOTAL 309,937,007,372 257,427,805,608 52,509,201,764 20.40%

equivalent to a decrease of -69.60%.
