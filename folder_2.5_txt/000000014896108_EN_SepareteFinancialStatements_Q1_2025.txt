IV- ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED
1- Principles for recognizing cash and cash equivalents.
Notes To The Financial Statements Quarter I - 2025 (Separate Statement)
Page 3Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank deposits, cash in transit, and short-term
investments with a recovery or maturity period not exceeding 3 months from the purchase date, which
can be readily converted into a determinable amount of cash and carry minimal risk of conversion.
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the exchange rates on the transaction dates. Monetary
items denominated in foreign currencies at the end of the period are revalued using the exchange rates
on the reporting date.
Exchange differences arising during the period and from revaluing monetary items at the end of the
period are recognized as income or expense in the reporting period.
2- Principles for recognizing inventory
Inventories are recognized at cost. Inventory costs include purchase costs, processing costs, and other
directly attributable costs incurred to bring inventories to their present location and condition.
Inventory cost is calculated using the weighted average method and is recorded using the perpetual
inventory system.
Provisions for inventory devaluation are recognized when the cost exceeds the net realizable value. Net
realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventories less the estimated costs of completion and
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
3-Principles for recognizing and depreciating fixed assets and investment properties
Fixed assets are recorded at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes all
expenses incurred by the Company to bring the fixed asset to a ready-to-use state. Subsequent expenses
are only capitalized if they are certain to increase the future economic benefits of the asset. Expenses
that do not meet these criteria are recognized as costs in the period incurred.
When fixed assets are sold or disposed of, their historical cost and accumulated depreciation arc
derecognized, and any resulting gain or loss is included in the period's income or expense..
Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives in accordance with
Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC dated April 25, 2013, issued by the Ministry of Finance. Depreciation
periods for asset groups are as follows:
Fixed Assets Years
Buildings and structures 10-50
Machinery and equipment 10-20
Vehicles and transmission equipment 10-30
Management tools and equipment 8-10
Perennial plantations 8-15
Other fixed assets 8-15
4- Principles for accounting for prepaid expenses:
Prepaid expenses are actual expenses incurred but related to the results of multiple accounting periods.
These costs are allocated systematically across the related accounting periods.
5- Principles for recognizing financial investments:
Investments in securities, subsidiaries, and associates are recognized at historical cost.
When an investment is liquidated, the difference between the net liquidation value and the book value
is recorded as income or expense in the period.
6- Principles for recognizing and capitalizing borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalized if they are directly related to the investment, construction, or
production of unfinished assets that require a substantial period of time (over 12 months) to be ready
for their intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period incurred.
For general-purpose loans used partially for investment, construction, or production of unfinished
assets, the capitalized borrowing costs are determined based on a capitalization rate applied to the
Notes To The Financial Statements Quarter I - 2025 (Separate Statement)
Page 4weighted average cumulative expenditure incurred for the construction or production of those assets.
The capitalization rate is calculated as the weighted average interest rate of outstanding loans during
the period, excluding specific loans intended for the acquisition of particular assets.
7- Principles for recognizing and capitalizing other costs
- Prepaid expenses
- Other expenses
- Method of allocating prepaid expenses: based on the time period and nature of the transactions.
8- Principles for recognizing accrued expenses
Accrued expenses are recognized based on reasonable estimates of amounts payable for goods and
services consumed during the period.
Trade payables and other payables are recognized based on invoices and supporting documents.
9- Principles and methods for recognizing provisions
Provisions are only recognized when the following conditions are met:
The Corporation has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
An outflow of economic benefits is probable to settle the obligation;
- A reliable estimate can be made of the obligation's value.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best reasonable estimate of the expenditure required to
settle the present obligation at the reporting date.
Only costs directly related to the originally established provision are offset against the provision.
Provisions are recognized as production and business expenses in the accounting period. If the unused
portion of a previously established provision exceeds the new provision for the reporting period, the
excess is reversed and recorded as a reduction in production and business expenses, except for excess
provisions for construction warranty obligations, which are reversed into other income in the
accounting period.
10- Principles for revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods and finished products is recognized when most risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred to the buyer, and there are no significant uncertainties regarding payment,
associated costs, or the likelihood of goods being returned.
Revenue from services is recognized when there are no significant uncertainties regarding payment or
associated costs. For services performed over multiple accounting periods, revenue for each period is
determined based on the completion rate of the service as of the financial year-end.
Interest, dividends, and profit-sharing revenue aie recognized when the Company is likely to receive
economic benefits from the transaction and the revenue amount can be measured reliably. Interest
income is recognized on a time basis using the applicable interest rate for each period. Dividends and
profit-sharing income are recognized when shareholders or capital contributors are entitled to receive
dividends or profit shares.
11- Principles and methods for recognizing financial expenses
Borrowing interest expenses are recognized based on bank statements, loan agreements, and other
financial expenses are recognized based on accounting documents.
12-Principles and methods for recognizing current corporate income tax and deferred corporate
income tax expenses
Notes To The Financial Statements Quarter 1 - 2025 (Separate Statement)
Page 5- Current Corporate Income Tax expenses are recognized using the provisional payment method.
- Deferred Corporate Income Tax expenses are determined and accounted for at the end of the year
13- Foreign exchange risk provisions
14- Other accounting principles and methods
