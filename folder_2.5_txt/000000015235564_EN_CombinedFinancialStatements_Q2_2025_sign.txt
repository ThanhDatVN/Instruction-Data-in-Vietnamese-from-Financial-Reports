33. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
Financial instruments of the Group mainly comprise cash, term and demand bank deposits, trade receivables,
loans receivables, other receivables, financial investments, trade payables, accrued expenses, other payables
and loans. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to mobilize financial resources for operations of
the Company.
Significant risks arising from financial instruments of the company is market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Risk management is integral to the whole business of the Company. The Company has a system of controls in
place to create an acceptable balance between the cost of risks occurring and the cost of managing the risks.
The Board of Management continually monitors the Company's risk management process to ensure that an
appropriate balance between risk and control are achieved.
The Board of Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are
summarized below:
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market prices. Market prices comprise four types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk (foreign
exchange risk), commodity price risk and other price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include
bank deposits.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because
of changes in market interest rates. Market risk due to changes in the Company's interest mainly related to
bank deposits.
The Company manages this risk by closely monitoring the relevant market, analysing the competition situation.
This will be a basis for the Company to estimate and adjust its financial leverage as well as financial strategy as
per the current situation in order to get the best interest rate which most benefits the Company and still within
its risk management limit.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
according to changes in exchange rates.
The company is less exposed to exchange rate fluctuations as it uses VND as the primary currency for its
operations.
Commodity price risk
The Company exposes to commodity price risk in relation to purchase of certain commodities. The Company
manages its commodity price risk by keeping close watch on relevant information and situation of commodity
market in order to properly manage timing of purchases, organize bidding for contractors or suppliers with high-
value contracts on the basis of fixed or package price.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer
contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily
for trade receivables) and from its financing activities (primarily for bank deposits).
Trade receivables
Customer credit risk is managed by the Company based on its established policy, procedures and control
relating to customer credit risk management.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and the Company seeks to maintain strict control
over its outstanding receivables. The requirement for impairment is analyzed at each reporting date on an
individual basis for major clients. In view of the aforementioned and the fact that the Company’s trade
receivables relate to a large number of diversified customers, there is no significant concentration of credit risk.

Bank deposits
The Company’s bank balances are mainly maintained with well-known banks in Vietnam. The company found
that concentrations of credit risk on bank deposits is low.
Short-term investments and loans receivables
The Company finds that the concentration of credit risk for short-term investments and loans is low
Liquidity risk
The liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligation due to
shortage of funds. The Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of maturities of
financial assets and liabilities.
The Company monitors its liquidity risk by maintain a level of cash and cash equivalents and loans deemed
adequate by management to finance the Company’s operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in
cash flows.

financial statement:
- The fair value of cash on hand, term and demand bank deposits, cash in transit other short-term
receivables, trade payables, accrued expenses and other payables equivalent to the books value of these
items because these tools have short terms.

such as the repayment ability of each customer as well as the risk nature of the financing project. Based on ^
this assessment, the Group estimates provisions for the estimated uncollectible portion of these
receivables. At the end of the fiscal year, the Group assessed that the carrying value of receivables after
deducting provisions was not significantly different from its fair value.
- The fair value of financial investments is determined by book value less provisions.

liquidity for loans are presented in the book value.
- Other financial assets and other financial liabilities that the fair value can not be determined with certainty
because there is no market liquidity for other assets and other liabilities are presented in the book value.
