statements are not intended to present the financial position and results of operations in accordance
with widely accepted accounting principles and practices in countries or regions outside of
Vietnam.
3. Accounting Methodology Applied:
The Fast Financial accounting software is applied.
IV- ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED
1. Principles for Recognizing Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank deposits with a maturity of less than 3
months, demand deposits, and cash in transit.
\
2. Principles for Accounting for Financial Investments:
Financial investments made in the form of capital contributions are recognized based on the
historical cost principle.
Provisions for losses on investments in other entities are established in accordance with current
accounting regulations. Accordingly, the Company may make provisions for investments when
the carrying amount exceeds the net assets of the investee entity as of the end of the accounting
period.
3. Principles for Accounting Receivables
The Company's receivables are monitored in detail according to payment terms, debtors, and the
type of foreign currency receivable.
Receivables in foreign currencies are revalued for exchange rate differences at the time of
preparing the financial statements, using the buying exchange rate of the commercial bank
designated by the Company for customer payments. In cases where the Company has multiple
receivables and transactions with various banks, it may choose the buying rate of one of the
commercial banks with which it frequently transacts.
Provisions for doubtful debts are made for receivables overdue for payment by six months or more
or for receivables deemed unlikely to be recovered due to liquidation, bankruptcy, or other similar
difficulties.
4. Principles for Inventory Recognition:
Inventories are recorded at cost, net of provisions for obsolescence, damage, or devaluation. The
cost of inventories includes direct material costs, direct labor costs, and applicable overhead costs
to bring the inventories to their current location and condition. The cost of inventories is

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Issued under Circular No.
200/2014/TT-BTC dated 22 December
For the accounting period ended June 30, 2025
2014 of the Ministry of Finance)
determined using the weighted average method. Net realizable value is calculated as the estimated
selling price less the costs of completion, marketing, sales, and distribution.
Provisions for inventory devaluation are established in accordance with current accounting
regulations. Accordingly, the Company may recognize provisions for obsolete, damaged, or
substandard inventories and in cases where the actual value of inventories exceeds their net
realizable value at the end of the accounting period.
Inventories are accounted for using the perpetual inventory method.
5. Principles of Recognizing and Depreciating Fixed Assets
Principles of Recognizing Fixed Assets (Tangible, Intangible, Finance Lease): Fixed assets are
recognized based on the original cost less accumulated depreciation. The original cost includes
the value of the fixed asset and all direct costs related to the formation of that fixed asset.
Depreciation Methods for Fixed Assets (Tangible, Intangible, Finance Lease): Fixed assets are
depreciated using the straight-line method. The depreciation rates for fixed assets and other related
regulations are carried out according to the guidelines in Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC dated
April 25, 2013, issued by the Ministry of Finance, guiding the management, use, and depreciation
of fixed assets.
The company applies estimated depreciation periods for various types of fixed assets as follows:
DEPRECIATION
No FIXED ASSETS UNIT
PERIOD
1 Buildings and structures 05-30 years
2 Machinery and equipment 06-20 years
3 Office equipment 03-10 years
4 Transport vehicles 06-10 years
5 Computer software 03 years
Liquidation of Fixed Assets: The profit or loss on the liquidation of fixed assets is determined as
the difference between the proceeds from the disposal and the net book value of the fixed asset
and is recognized as either income or expense in the income statement.
6. Accounting Principles for Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses are actual costs incurred that are related to business operations over multiple
accounting periods. These costs are not fully recognized as expenses in the current period but are
gradually allocated to subsequent accounting periods.
The calculation and allocation of prepaid expenses to production and business costs in each
accounting period are based on the nature and magnitude of each type of expense.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STA TEMENTS Issued under Circular No.

For the accounting period ended June 30, 2025 2014 of the Ministry of Finance)
Allocating Prepaid Expenses: Prepaid expenses are allocated using the straight-line method.
7. Principles of Accounting for Payables
The debts payable are monitored in detail according to the repayment term, the debtor, the type of
foreign currency payable, and several other factors as required by the Company's management at
each point in time.
Based on the remaining maturity of the payables, they are classified as either long-term or short­
term liabilities.
When there is evidence indicating that a loss is likely to occur, the company will recognize a
payable in accordance with the prudence principle.
At the end of the period, payables that meet the definition of monetary items in foreign currencies
will be revalued.
8. Recognition Principles for Borrowings and Financial Lease Liabilities
Loans and finance lease liabilities do not include loans in the form of bond issuance or the issuance
of preferred stock with mandatory buyback terms by the issuer at a specific time in the future.
Borrowing costs directly related to loans (other than interest payable), such as appraisal fees,
auditing fees, loan documentation costs, etc., are recorded as financial expenses. If these costs
arise from loans dedicated to investment, construction, or production of unfinished assets, they
should be capitalized.
For finance lease liabilities, the total lease liability is the total amount payable, calculated based
on the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset.
Loans and finance lease liabilities are recorded in detail according to each borrower, debtor, loan
agreement, and type of loan. In the case of foreign currency loans or debts, detailed records should
be kept in the original currency, and exchange rate differences should be recognized and evaluated
according to the regulations.
9. Recognition and Capitalization Principles for Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly related to the acquisition, construction, or production of assets that
require a relatively long time to complete and be ready for use or business operations should be
added to the cost of the asset until it is ready for use or operations. Income arising from the
temporary investment of borrowed funds should be deducted from the cost of the related asset.
All other borrowing costs should be recognized as expenses in the income statement when
incurred.
10. Principles for recognizing accrued expenses
Accrued Expenses are actual expenses that have not yet occurred but are estimated and accounted
for in advance as part of production and business expenses during the accounting period. This is
done to ensure that when the actual expenses arise, they do not cause a sudden impact on
Trang 5/30DINH vư PETROLEUM SERVICES PORT JOIST STOCK COMPANY
Form B 09a - DN
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STA TEMENTS Issued under Circular No.
200/2014/TT-BTC dated 22 December
For the accounting period ended June 30, 2025 2014 of the Ministry of Finance)
production and business costs in future periods. The recognition of accrued expenses must adhere
to the principle of matching, ensuring that revenues and the related expenses are recognized in the
same period.
11. Principles of recognizing equity capital.
Equity capital is the net assets of the enterprise remaining under the ownership of the shareholders
(owners).
The contributed capital is recorded based on the actual amount contributed, not based on the
committed amount to be contributed by the owners, and not based on the charter capital stated in
the business registration certificate. The contributed capital of shareholders is reflected in two
separate indicators: Owner's contributed capital and capital surplus. Owner's contributed capital
consists of common shares with voting rights. Capital surplus reflects the difference between the
par value and the issue price of shares (including cases of reissuing treasury shares) and can be a
positive surplus (if the issue price is higher than the par value) or a negative surplus (if the issue
price is lower than the par value).
In cases where capital contributions are made in non-monetary assets, they must be recognized at
the fair value of the non-monetary assets at the contribution date. For capital contributions made
with assets, the owner’s equity is recorded based on the revalued value of the assets as agreed
upon by the contributing parties. Intangible assets, such as trademarks, brand names, trade names,
rights to exploit, or develop projects, can only be recognized as an increase in contributed capital
if permitted by the applicable laws.
The use of owner’s capital, asset revaluation differences, and development funds to offset business
losses is carried out based on the owner’s decision. The Company must complete all procedures
in accordance with legal regulations when utilizing these resources.
Profit distribution is only carried out when the enterprise has undistributed after-tax profits. Any
case of paying dividends or profits to owners exceeding the amount of undistributed after-tax
profits is essentially considered a reduction of contributed capital. The enterprise must complete
all procedures in accordance with legal regulations and adjust its business registration license
accordingly.
12. Principles and Methods for Recognizing Revenue and Other Income
Revenue is the economic benefit gained that increases the owner's equity of the enterprise,
excluding additional contributions from shareholders. Revenue is recognized at the time the
transaction occurs, when it is certain that economic benefits will be obtained, and is measured at
the fair value of the amounts to which the enterprise is entitled, regardless of whether the cash has
been received.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Issued under Circular No.
200/2014/TT-BTC dated 22 December
For the accounting period ended June 30, 2025
2014 of the Ministry of Finance)
Revenue and the related costs that generate that revenue must be recognized simultaneously
according to the matching principle. However, in certain cases, the matching principle may
conflict with the prudence principle. In such cases, the nature of the transaction and applicable
accounting standards should be followed to ensure truthful and reasonable representation.
Revenue, gains, or losses are considered unrealized if the enterprise still has obligations to fulfill
in the future (excluding standard warranty obligations) or if the receipt of economic benefits is
uncertain. The classification of gains or losses as realized or unrealized does not depend on
whether cash flows have occurred. Gains or losses arising from the revaluation of assets or
liabilities are not considered unrealized because, at the time of revaluation, the enterprise already
has rights to the assets and current obligations for liabilities.
Revenue does not include amounts collected on behalf of third parties.
The timing and basis for recognizing accounting revenue and taxable revenue may differ
depending on specific situations. Taxable revenue is used solely to determine tax liabilities
according to statutory regulations. Revenue recognized in the accounting records for financial
statement preparation must comply with accounting principles and may not necessarily match the
amounts recorded on sales invoices.
Revenue recognized includes only the revenue attributable to the reporting period.
Financial income includes interest income, royalties, dividends, profit sharing, and other financial
income generated by the enterprise.
Other income comprises income from infrequent activities, outside the scope of regular revenue­
generating activities.
When it is reasonably certain that penalties for contract breaches will be received, the nature of
the penalty must be considered to recognize it appropriately for each specific case.
13. Principles for accounting cost of goods sold
Accounting cost of goods sold reflects the cost value of goods and services sold during the period.
Provisions for inventory devaluation are included in accounting cost of goods sold based on the
quantity of inventory and the difference between the net realizable value (if it is lower) and the
original cost of the inventory.
Accounting cost of goods sold must be recognized on a basis that aligns with the revenue
generated during the period.
14. Principles and Methods for Recognizing Financial Expenses:
Financial expenses include costs or losses associated with financial investment activities,
borrowing and lending activities, contributions to joint ventures and associates, losses from the
transfer of short-term securities, transaction costs for selling securities, provisions for devaluation
Trang 7/30DINH VU PETROLEUM SERVICES PORT JOINT STOCK COMPANY

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Issued under Circular No.
200/2014/TT-BTC dated 22 December

2014 of the Ministry of Finance)
of trading securities, provisions for losses on investments in other entities, foreign currency sale
losses, and foreign exchange rate differences, among others.
Borrowing costs include interest expenses and other costs directly related to the company's
borrowings.
Borrowing costs are recognized as production and operating expenses in the period they are
incurred, except when they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production
of qualifying assets. In such cases, they are capitalized as part of the asset's cost, provided the
conditions stipulated in accounting standards are met.
15. Principles for Recognizing Selling Expenses and General Administrative Expenses:
Selling expenses are the actual costs incurred during the process of selling products, goods, or
providing services.
General administrative expenses are the general management costs of the enterprise.
Selling expenses and general administrative expenses that are not deductible for corporate income
tax (CIT) purposes under tax law but are supported by valid invoices and documents and have
been recorded in accordance with the accounting regime are not reduced in accounting records.
Instead, these expenses are adjusted in the CIT finalization process to increase the amount of CIT
payable.
16. Principles for Recognizing Current Corporate Income Tax (CIT) and Deferred CIT Expenses
Corporate income tax reflects the total value of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax payable calculated based on taxable income for the year. Taxable income differs from
net profit presented in the income statement as it excludes taxable income or deductible expenses
in other years (including tax loss carryforwards, if any) and excludes non-taxable or non­
deductible items.
According to current tax laws, the Company is entitled to CIT incentives, such as: A 10% CIT
rate for 15 years from the first year the company generates revenue from tax-incentive activities,
and a 20% rate in subsequent years. Exemption from CIT for 4 years and a 50% reduction in
payable tax for the next 9 years starting from the first year the company has taxable income from
the investment project. If there is no taxable income within the first 3 years from the year revenue
is generated, the exemption/reduction period starts in the fourth year. Starting from 2024, the
company will no longer receive a 50% tax reduction.
Taxable income from expanded investment activities is subject to the normal CIT rate of 20%.
The Company opts for CIT exemption for 4 years from the first year taxable income is generated
and a 50% reduction in payable CIT for the next 9 years. This is the seventh year the Company
applies the 20% CIT rate and the 50% reduction for taxable income from expanded investment

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Issued under Circular No.
200/2014/TT-BTC dated 22 December
For the accounting period ended June 30, 2025 2014 of the Ministry of Finance)
The determination of the Company's income tax is based on the current tax regulations. However,
these regulations may change over time, and the final determination of corporate income tax
depends on the results of inspections conducted by the competent tax authorities.
Calculated based on temporary differences between the carrying value and taxable base of assets
or liabilities reported on the financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that
sufficient future taxable profit will be available to utilize these temporary differences. Deferred
CIT is determined using the tax rates expected to apply when assets are recovered or liabilities are
settled.
Deferred income tax is determined based on the tax rate expected to apply in the year when the
assets are recovered or the liabilities are settled. Deferred income tax is recognized in the income
statement, except for cases where the tax is related to items that are directly recorded in equity. In
such cases, deferred income tax is also directly recorded in equity'.
The Company did not recognize corporate income tax for the period as it did not generate taxable
income. Deferred tax assets related to carryforward tax losses and other temporary differences
were not recognized due to uncertainty about their future utilization. t
