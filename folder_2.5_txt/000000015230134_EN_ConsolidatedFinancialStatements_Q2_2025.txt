IV. ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLIED
1. Basis for preparing Consolidated Financial Statements
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting (except for
information relating to cash flows).
2. Consolidated basis
The consolidated financial statements include the consolidated financial statements of the parent
company and the financial statements of its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity controlled by
the parent company . Control exists when the parent company has the power, directly or
indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of a subsidiary so as to obtain benefits
from its activities. In determining control, potential voting rights arising from call options or
debt and equity instruments that are convertible into common shares at the balance sheet date are
taken into account.
The results of operations of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the period are presented in the / #
Consolidated Statement of Income from the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale of the
investment in that subsidiary. x
The financial statements of the parent company and the subsidiaries used for consolidation are
prepared for the same accounting period and apply uniform accounting policies to like
transactions and events in similar circumstances. In case the accounting policies of a subsidiary
differ from those applied consistently in the Group, the financial statements of the subsidiary (
will be appropriately adjusted before being used for preparing the consolidated financial
statements. V \ (
Balances of accounts in the Balance Sheet between companies in the same Group, intra-group
transactions and unrealized profits arising from these transactions must be eliminated in full.
Unrealized losses arising from intra-group transactions are also eliminated unless the costs
creating the loss are unrecoverable.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of the profits or losses in the results of operations
and net assets of a subsidiary not held by the Group and are presented in a separate line item in
the consolidated income statement and in the consolidated balance sheet (as part of equity).
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of the non-controlling interests at the date of the
original business combination and the non-controlling interest in changes in equity since the date
of the combination. Losses incurred by the subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling
interest in proportion to the non-controlling interest, even if such losses exceed the non­
controlling interest in the net assets of the subsidiary.

3. Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the
transaction. Balances of foreign currency items at the end of the accounting period are translated
at the exchange rate on that date.
Exchange rate differences arising during the period from foreign currency transactions are
recorded in financial income or financial expenses. Exchange rate differences arising from
revaluation of foreign currency items at the end of the accounting period after offsetting the
increase and decrease are recorded in financial income or financial expenses.
The exchange rate used to convert transactions in foreign currency is the actual exchange rate at
the time of the transaction. The actual exchange rate for transactions in foreign currency is
determined as follows:
• For foreign currency purchase and sale contracts (spot foreign currency purchase and sale
contracts, forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, swap contracts): exchange
rate signed in the foreign currency purchase and sale contract between the Group and the
bank.
• For capital contributions or receipt of capital contributions: foreign currency buying rate of
the bank where the Group opens an account to receive capital from investors on the date of
capital contribution.
• For receivables: foreign currency buying rate of the commercial bank where the Group
designates the customer to make payment at the time the transaction occurs.
• For payables: cross exchange rate of Vietnamese Dong against some foreign currencies
applied for calculating export tax and import tax announced by the State Bank.
• For asset purchases or expenses paid immediately in foreign currency (not through payable
accounts): foreign currency buying rate of the commercial bank where the Group makes
payment.
The exchange rate used to re-evaluate the balance of foreign currency monetary items at the end
of the accounting period is determined according to the following principles:
• For foreign currency deposits at banks: foreign currency buying rate of the bank where the
Group opens a foreign currency account.
• For foreign currency monetary items classified as other assets: foreign currency buying rate
of Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade ( the Group's regular
transaction bank).
• For foreign currency items classified as liabilities: cross exchange rates of Vietnamese Dong
against a number of foreign currencies applied to calculate export and import taxes
announced by the State Bank.
4. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term investments with a
maturity of no more than 03 months from the date of investment, which can be easily converted
into a known amount of cash and are subject to no risk of change in value at the reporting date.
5. Financial investments
Held to maturity investments
Investments are classified as held-to-maturity when the Group has the intention and ability to
hold them until maturity. The Group's held-to-maturity investments consist only of term
deposits with the intention of earning periodic interest.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price
and any costs associated with the purchase of the investments. After initial recognition, these
investments are recognized at their recoverable amount. Interest income from investments held
to maturity after the acquisition date is recognized in the Income Statement on an accrual basis.

Notes to consolidated financial statements (Cont)
Interest earned before the Group holds the investment is deducted from the cost at the
acquisition date.
When there is strong evidence that pail or all of the investment may not be recovered and the
amount of loss can be reliably determined, the loss is recorded in financial expenses, during the
period and directly deduct the investment value.
Investments in associates
An associate is an enterprise in which the Group has significant influence but not control over
the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is the power to participate in the
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not control over those policies.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. Accordingly, the
investment in an associate is presented in the consolidated financial statements at its initial
investment cost and adjusted for changes in the Group’s share of the associate's net assets after
the date of investment. If the Group's interest in the associate's losses exceeds or equals the
carrying amount of the investment, the value of the investment presented in the consolidated
financial statements is zero unless the Group has obligations to make payments on behalf of the
associate.
The financial statements of the associates are prepared for the same accounting period as the
consolidated financial statements of the Group. When the accounting policies of the associates
are different from the accounting policies applied consistently in the Group, the financial
statements of the associates will be appropriately adjusted before being used for the preparation
of the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent
attributable to the Group when preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Investments in equity instruments of o tit er entities
Investments in equity instruments of other entities include investments in equity instruments but
the Group does not have control joint control or significant influence over the investee.
Investments in equity instruments of other entities are initially recorded at cost, including the ¿w
purchase price or capital contribution plus direct costs related to the investment. Dividends from J j
periods before the investment is purchased are recorded as a reduction in the value of the ■
investment itself. Dividends and profits from periods after the investment is purchased are
recorded as revenue. Dividends received in the form of shares are only recorded as the number
of shares increased, not the value of the shares received. '^¡f-
Provision for losses on investments in equity instruments of other entities is made as follows:
• For investments in listed shares or for which the fair value of the investment is reliably
determined, the provision is based on the market value of the shares.
• For investments whose fair value cannot be determined at the reporting date, provisions arc
made based on the loss of the investee with the provision equal to the difference between the
actual investment capital of the owners and the equity at the end of the accounting period
multiplied by the ratio of the Group's charter capital to the total contributed charter capital at
other units.
Increases and decreases in the provision for investment losses in equity instruments of other
entities that need to be set up at the end of the accounting period are recorded in financial
expenses.

result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.

expected future cash outflows required to settle the obligation at a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
7/oy

difference is accounted for as a reduction in expenses.
16. Equity

properties, interest is capitalized even if the construction period is less than 12 months. Income
from temporary' investment of loans is recorded as a reduction in the cost of the relevant asset.
For general borrowings used for the purpose of investment in construction or production of
unfinished assets, the capitalized borrowing costs are determined according to the capitalization
rate for the weighted average cumulative costs incurred for investment in basic construction or
production of that asset. The capitalization rate is calculated according to the weighted average
interest rate of the outstanding borrowings during the period, except for separate borrowings
serving the purpose of forming a specific asset.
20. Expenses
Expenses are amounts that reduce economic benefits and are recognized at the time the
transaction occurs or when it is relatively certain that they will arise in the future, regardless of
whether money has been spent or not.
Expenses and revenues generated by them must be recorded simultaneously according to the
matching principle. In case the matching principle conflicts with the prudence principle,
expenses are recorded based on the nature and provisions of accounting standards to ensure that
transactions are reflected honestly and reasonably.
21. Corporate income tax

Current income tax
Current income tax is the tax that is calculated on taxable income. Taxable income differs from
accounting profit due to adjustments for temporary differences between tax and accounting, non-
deductible expenses as well as adjustments for non-taxable income and losses carried forward.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is the income tax payable or recoverable in respect of temporary
differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and their tax basis. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary
differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognised only when it is probable that future
taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be
utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available
to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Previously unrecognised deferred tax
assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognised to the extent that it is
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise the unrecognised deferred tax
assets.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the
year when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted at
the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised in the income statement and, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, is dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when:
• The Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current income tax assets against current
income tax liabilities; and
• These deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the
same tax authority:
- For the same taxable entity; or
- The Group intends to settle its current income tax liabilities and current income tax assets
on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each
future period in which significant amounts of deferred income tax liabilities or deferred
income tax assets are expected to be settled or realised.
22. Related parties
Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control the other party or
exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions.
Parties are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common
significant influence.
In considering any related party' relationship, attention is directed more to the substance of the
relationship than to the legal form.
23. Report by department
A business segment is a distinguishable component that is engaged in providing products or
services and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business
segments.
A geographical segment is a distinguishable component that is engaged in providing products or
services within a particular economic environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are
different from those of components operating in other economic environments.

2. Listed stock code: DNW
Pursuant to Circular No.96/2020/TT-BTC dated November 16, 2020 of the
Ministry of Finance on guidance on information disclosure on the stock market, Dong
Nai Water Joint Stock Company explains the situation of fluctuations in Profit after
Corporate Income Tax (CIT) in the Quarter II of 2025, which decreased by more than
10% compared to Profit after CIT in the Quarter II of 2024 as follows:

2 consolidated 38,534,536,769 126,759,574,895 -88,225,038,126 -69.60%
financial statements
Reasons for fluctuations in profit after CIT of separate financial statements:
1. Total revenue and other income in the Quarter II of 2025 reached VND
305,861,620,785, decreased by VND 46,465,791,013 compared to revenue and other
income in the same period of 2024 (reaching VND 352,327,411,798), corresponding to
a decrease of -13.19%.
The changes in revenue are as follows:
Quarter II Quarter II % increase

TOTAL 305,861,620,785 352,327,411,798 -46,465,791,013 -13.19%
The main reason is that financial revenue decreased by VND 47,469,670,754,
equivalent to a decrease of -83.86%, due to the previous year's exchange rate
difference profit arising from evaluating the outstanding loan balance in foreign
currency, however it did not arise this year.
12. Total expenses in the Quarter II of 2025 reached VND 271,067,138,058,
compared to the same period in 2024, it was VND 221,632,934,156, an increase of
VND 49,434,203,902, equivalent to an increase of 22.30%.
The cost changes are as follows:
Quarter II Quarter II % increase
Difference
This year Last year /(decrease)
Cost of goods sold 179,526,345,000 176,703,607,380 2,822,737,620 1.60%

TOTAL 271,067,138,058 221,632,934,156 49,434,203,902 22.30%
The main reason is that financial expenses increased by VND 44,724,783,263,
equivalent to an increase of 442.45%, due to this year's exchange rate difference loss
in evaluating foreign currency loan balances.
The combination of the above effects has decreased the profit after CIT in the
Quarter II of 2025 by VND 85,721,303,850 compared to the same period in 2024,
equivalent to a decrease of -73.27%.
Reasons for fluctuations in profit after CIT of the consolidated financial
statements:
1. Total revenue and other income in the quarter II of 2025 of the parent company
and its subsidiaries reached VND 352,044,980,646, a decrease of VND

TOTAL 352,044,980,646 398,265,144,695 -46,220,164,049 -11.61%
The main reason is that Financial Revenue decreased by VND 50,358,030,002,
equivalent to a decrease of -85.99%, due to the previous year's exchange rate
difference profit arising from the evaluation of foreign currency Ioan balances,
however this year it did not arise at the Parent Company.
2. Total expenses in Quarter II of 2025 of the parent company and its subsidiaries
reached VND 309,937,007,372, compared to the same period in 2024, which was
VND 257,427,805,608, an increase of VND 52,509,201,764, equivalent to an increase
of 20.40%.

TOTAL 309,937,007,372 257,427,805,608 52,509,201,764 20.40%
The main reason is that financial expenses increased by VND 44,724,783,263,
equivalent to an increase of 442.45%, due to the exchange rate difference loss in
evaluating the outstanding foreign currency loans at the parent company.
The combination of the above impacts has caused the profit after CIT in Quarter II
of 2025 to decrease by VND 88,225,038,126 compared to the same period in 2024,
equivalent to a decrease of -69.60%.
