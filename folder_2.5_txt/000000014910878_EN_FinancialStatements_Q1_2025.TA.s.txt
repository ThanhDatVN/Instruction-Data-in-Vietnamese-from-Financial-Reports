III. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTING REGIME
1. Accounting System
The Company applies the Vietnamese Accounting Regime for Enterprises issued under Circular No. 200/2014/TT-BTC dated
December 22, 2014, and Circular No. 53/2016/TT-BTC dated March 21, 2016, which amends and supplements some articles of
Circular No. 200/2014/TT-BTC issued by the Ministry of Finance.
2. Statement of Compliance with Accounting Standards and Regimes
The accompanying financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Vietnamese Accounting Standards and the
Vietnamese Accounting System for Enterprises as promulgated and currently in effect.
IV. APPLIED POLICIES
The Company applies the following accounting principles:
1. Principle for Recognizing Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include: Cash on hand, demand deposits at banks, short-term investments with a maturity of
no more than 3 months and no risk in converting to cash, or investments with high liquidity. High-liquidity investments
are those that can be converted into a specific amount of cash within less than 3 months and with minimal risk
related to fluctuations in the conversion value
2. Accounting Principles for Financial Investments
Investments include fixed-term deposits, investments in equity instruments of companies over which the company
has no control or significant influence. Investments are reflected at their original cost
3. Principle for Accounting Receivables
Receivables include accounts receivable from customers, prepayments to suppliers, and other receivables at the reporting date.
Receivables are presented at their carrying amount less allowance for doubtful accounts. Provision for for doubtful accounts is
compiled according to Circular 48/2019/TT-BTC dated August 8, 2019, of the Ministry of Finance.
4. Principle for Recognizing Inventory
Inventories are valued at cost price. If the net realizable value is lower than cost, inventories must be stated at the net realizable
value. The cost of inventories includes purchase costs, processing costs, and other directly related costs to bring the inventory to
its present location and condition. The net realizable value is determined by estimating the selling price less completion and
selling costs. Inventories are accounted for using the periodic method and cost is calculated based on the actual cost method.
5. Principle for Recognizing and Depreciating Fixed Assets, Leased Assets, and Investment Properties
Fixed assets are recognized at cost. During usage, fixed assets are recorded at original cost, accumulated depreciation, and
carrying value. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method. The depreciation period is applied according to
Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC dated April 25, 2013, issued by the Ministry of Finance, which provides guidance on the
management, use, and depreciation of fixed assets. Specifically, as follows:Fixed Asset Group Useful Life (years)
Buildings and structures 8-30
Machinery and equipment 4-10
Transportation and transmission vehicles 5-10
Management equipment and tools 4-10
Other assets 4-10
Intangible Fixed Assets and Depreciation
Intangible fixed assets include the mining rights at the Suối Mơ quarry, land use rights and accounting software.The mining
rights at the Hoc Tra quarry are depreciated by the Company using the straight-line method over the periods of 7 years, 4 years,
and 2 years and 3 months, respectively.
6. Work-in-Progress Construction Costs
Assets under construction intended for production, rental, administration, or any other purposes are recognized at cost. This cost
includes service fees and related interest expenses in accordance with the company's accounting policies. The depreciation of
these assets is applied similarly to other assets, starting from when the assets are ready for use.
7. Long-term prepaid expenses
Long-term prepaid expenses include the costs of machinery and office equipment that do not qualify as fixed assets, tools and
equipment costs, repair costs pending allocation, and other long-term prepaid expenses. Long-term prepaid expenses related to
tools and equipment are initially recorded at their original cost and allocated using the straight-line method over a maximum
period of 3 years.
8. Accrued expenses
The actual expenses that have not yet occurred but are accrued in advance as production and business costs within the period are
done to ensure that when the actual costs arise, they do not cause a sudden increase in production and business costs, based on
the principle of matching revenue and expenses. When these expenses are incurred, if there is a difference from the amount
already accrued, the accountant will make an adjustment by either increasing or decreasing the expenses to reflect the difference
accordingly.
9. Principles and Methods for Recognizing Provisions for Liabilities
The recognized value of a provision for liabilities is the best estimate of the amount of money that
will be required to settle the current obligation at the end of the fiscal year or accounting period.
Only expenses related to the initially established provision for liabilities can be offset by that provision.
The difference between the provision for liabilities established in the Prior accounting period
that has not been fully utilized and the provision for liabilities established in the reporting period
should be reversed and recorded as a reduction in production and business expenses for the period,
except for the difference exceeding the provision for warranty liabilities on construction projects,
which should be reversed into other income for the period.
10. Principles for recognizing equity
The owner's invested capital is recognized based on the actual capital contributed by the owners.
Retained earnings are the profit from the company’s operations after deducting (-) adjustments for the retrospective
application of changes in accounting policies and retrospective adjustments for material errors of prior years.
11. Revenue Recognition Principles and Methods
- Sales revenue
ales revenue is recognized when all of the following five (5) conditions are simultaneously met:
+ The company has transferred most of the risks and rewards associated with ownership of the product or
goods to the buyer;
+ The company no longer retains control over the goods as the owner or has the ability to control the goods.
+ Determined revenue is reasonably certain;
+ The company is likely to receive economic benefits from the sale transaction;
+ The costs associated with the sale transaction can be reliably measured.
Interest income from investments is recognized when the company has the right to receive the interest.
12. Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of assets that require
a substantial period of time to complete and bring into use or operation are capitalized into the cost of the asset
until the asset is ready for use or operation. Any income arising from the temporary investment of borrowings
is deducted from the cost of the related asset. All other borrowing costs are recognized in
the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.13. Tax
Corporate income tax represents the total value of the current tax payable.
The current tax payable is calculated based on the taxable income for the year.
Taxable income differs from the net profit presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income
as it excludes income or expenses taxable or deductible in different years (including any carried-forward losses, if applicable).
Additionally, it excludes items that are non-taxable or non-deductible.
The determination of the Company's income tax is based on the current tax regulations. However, these regulations are subject to
change over time,
and the final detennination of corporate income tax depends on the results of inspections by the relevant tax authorities.
Other taxes are applied in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in Vietnam.
14. Related parties
Related parties are considered to include entities such as the Parent Company, its subsidiaries, as well as individuals who, either
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, have control over the Company
or share joint control with the Company. Affiliated parties and individuals who, directly or indirectly, have significant voting
power
in the Company and can exert significant influence over the Company. Key management personnel, such as directors and officers
of the Company, as well as close family members of these individuals or the affiliated parties, or companies associated with
these individuals, are also considered related parties, these individuals, are also considered related parties.

THANH AN 96 C&I JSC Independence - Liberty - Happiness
No.: 468 /JSC-BKS Da Nang, April 29,h, 2025
"Explanation of the reason for the difference in
profit and loss of over J0% of the financial
statements of the first quarter of2025 compared to
the financial statements of the first quarter of2024"
To:
- The State Securities Commission;
- Hanoi Stock Exchange.
According to Circular 96/2020/TT-BTC guiding the disclosure of information on
the stock market, listed companies must explain that the profit after CIT of the reporting
period changes by 10% or more compared to the same period of the previous year.
In the financial statement of the first quarter of 2025 of Thanh An 96
Construction Joint Stock Company, the profit after tax is: VND 977,989,625, down
more than 64.1% compared to the first quarter of 2024 (VND 2,726,294,369).
Thanh An 96 Construction Joint Stock Company explained that the profit after
tax in the first quarter of 2025 decreased compared to the same period last year as
follows:
In the first quarter of 2025, the Company deploys forces, focusing on organizing
the construction of works to ensure progress according to the contract signed with the
investor. The company focuses on and is active in the preparation of acceptance and
settlement documents for projects. However, some work items have not yet reached the
time of acceptance, therefore, in the first quarter of 2025, the value of sales and service
provision revenue will reach: VND 120.1 billion, smaller than the revenue of the same
period in 2024 (VND 3 62.3 billion). In addition, revenue from financial activities
decreased a lot compared to the same period last year: 47.6% (1,176 billion VND/2,245
billion VND). The ratio of cost of goods sold to net revenue is relatively stable.
Therefore, the main reason for the decrease in profit after tax in the first quarter of 2025
by 64.1% compared to the same period last year was the decrease in sales and service
revenue in the period and the decrease in revenue from financial activities compared to
the same period last year.
Thanh An 96 Construction Joint Stock Company explained to the State
Securities Commission, the Hanoi Stock Exchange and investors^.
