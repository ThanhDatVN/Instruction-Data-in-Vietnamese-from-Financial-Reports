Transport issued Decision No. 3402/QD-BGTVT annoucing the enterprise value for the equitization
of Vietnam Maritime Corporation - Parent Company. On 20 June 2018, the Prime Minister issued
Decision No. 751/QD-TTg approving the equitization plan of Vietnam Maritime Corporation - Parent
Company. On 18 June 2020, the State Capital Management Committee at Enterprises issued a
Decision No. 277/QF-UBQLV to adjust the scale and structure charter capital according to the results ^o?
of the initial share offering of Vietnam Maritime Corporation. The Corporation successfully held the
first General Meeting of Shareholders on 13 August 2020 and officially changed to operate as a Joint TONG
Stock Company on 18 August 2020.
The Corporation operates under the Business Registration Certificate No. 0100104595 issued X
by the Department of Planning and Investment of Hanoi City for the first time on 07 July 2010. From
18 August 2020, the Corporation changed its 7th Certificate of Business to officially switch to

The Corporation's headquarters is located at: Ocean Park Building, No. 1 Dao Duy Anh, Phuong
Mai Ward, Dong Da District, Hanoi City.
1.2. BUSINESS FIELDS
The main business activities of the Corporation include coastal and deep-sea freight
transportation, inland waterway, road transport, and related transport support services; port operation,
inland waterway port operation; agency services, freight forwarding, logistics, warehousing, and cargo
storage.
1.3. CHARACTERISTICS OF CORPORATION ACTIVITIES DURING THE
ACCOUNTING PERIOD THAT AFFECT THE SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In the first quarter of 2025, Vietnam’s economy maintained its growth, providing a significant
boost to import-export activities - a major favorable factor for maritime transport operations. However,
the global economic recovery remained slow and uncertain, directly impacting cargo transportation
demand and potentially leading to reduced shipping volumes. Geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea region
continued to disrupt trade routes, increasing operating costs and causing substantial, unpredictable
volatility in international freight rates. Rising competitive pressure from new shipping fleets in the global
market has intensified, exerting downward pressure on both revenue and profit margins in the maritime
transport segment. As a result, Vietnam Maritime Corporation recorded a consolidated pre-tax profit of
only VND 24 billion in Quarter 1/2025, compared to VND 65 billion in the same period last year.
