Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets
are capitalized as part of the asset's cost. These include interest expenses, amortization of discounts or premiums
on bond issuance and ancillary costs incurred during the borrowing process.
The capitalization of borrowing costs should be temporarily suspended in periods during which the investment
in construction or production of uncompleted assets is interrupted, except for cases where such interruption is
necessary.
The capitalization of borrowing should cease when substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare the
asset for its intended use or sale are complete. Borrowing costs arising afterward should be recognized as in­
period production or business costs.
Income generated from the temporary investment of specific borrowings, pending their utilization for the
acquisition of qualifying assets, must be deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.
The amount of borrowing costs capitalized during a period must not exceed the amount of borrowing costs
incurred during that period. Interest expenses and the amortization of discounts or premiums capitalized during a
period must not exceed the actual interest incurred and the amount of discounts or premiums amortized during

expenses in the period to ensure that when actual expenses arise, they do not cause sudden changes in
production and business expenses on the basis of ensuring the principle of matching between revenue and
expenses.
When such costs arise, if there is a difference with the amount deducted, the accountant will record additional or
reduce the cost corresponding to the difference.
- For specific fixed assets whose repair is cyclical, the major repair costs for these assets are provided based on
estimates or plans and are recorded as production and business expenses.

Explanation for the change by more than 10% in the 1th quarter 2025 business results compared to the same period
36
last year:
The Company’s net profit after tax for the 1th quarter of 2025 decreased by more than 10% compared to Ql/2024 mainly
due to the following reasons:
+ Gross profit from sales and service provision increased by VND 6 billion compared to the same period in 2024, thanks to
the Company’s effective utilization of the market opportunity of slightly increased freight rates, along with the application
of cost-saving solutions that helped reduce cost of goods sold and improve efficiency.
+ Other profit decreased by VND 48 billion, mainly due to reduced income from financial settlements as banks and credit
institutions reduced obligations related to debt repayments.

Market risk: The Company purchases raw materials, goods, tools, and supplies from both domestic and foreign suppliers to
support its business operations. Therefore, the Company is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the prices of these
materials, goods, tools, and supplies. This risk is mitigated by sourcing from a diverse range of suppliers located in various
countries and regions, as well as maintaining flexibility in negotiating and adjusting sale prices to customers in response to
significant price fluctuations in the market.
Credit risk: Consist of liquidity risk and interest rate risk: The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that funds
are available to meet current and future liabilities. The Company's policy is to regularly monitor the liquidity requirements
for current and expected future liabilities to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet short-term and long-term
liquidity needs.
