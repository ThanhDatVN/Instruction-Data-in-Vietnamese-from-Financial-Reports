REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW ENGAGEMENT
On the Interim Financial Statements
For the Six-Month Period Ended December 31, 2025
Dear Esteemed Shareholders, Board of Directors, and Executive Management
HSV Vietnam Group Joint Stock Company
We have reviewed the accompanying interim financial statements of HSV Vietnam Group Joint Stock
Company, prepared on August 05, 2025, from page 07 to page 46. These statements include the interim
balance sheet as of June 30, 2025, the interim income statement, the interim cash flow statement for the
six-month period of the financial year ending December 31, 2025, and the notes to the interim financial
statements.
Responsibility of the Executive Management
The Executive Management of HSV Vietnam Group Joint Stock Company is responsible for the
preparation and fair presentation of the interim financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese
Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting System, and relevant legal regulations
applicable to the preparation and presentation of interim financial statements. Management is also
responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of interim
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Si
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements based on our review.
We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review Engagements (VSRE)
2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity.
A review of interim financial information consists primarily of making inquiries, mainly of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Auditing
Standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

Auditor’s Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
interim financial statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the interim financial position
of HSV Vietnam Group Joint Stock Company as of June 30. 2025. and its interim financial
performance and cash flows for the six-month period of the financial year ending December 31. 2025.
in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting System,
and relevant legal regulations governing the preparation and presentation of interim financial
statements.
Other Matters
The interim financial statements for the six-month period ended December 31, 2024. and the financial
statements for the year 2024 of HSV Vietnam Group Joint Stock Company were reviewed and audited
by AASC Auditing Firm Company Limited, with an unqualified audit opinion.

IV. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
I. Basis of Preparation of the Interim Financial Statements
The interim financial statements are prepared on an accrual accounting basis (except for cash
flow information).
2. Recognition Principles for Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank deposits, cash in transit, and short-term
investments with maturities or redemption periods of no more than 3 months from the date of
purchase. These are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and arc subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value.
3. Accounting Principles for Financial Investments
Held-to-maturity in vestments
An investment is classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the intention and ability
to hold it until maturity. Held-to-maturity investments include term bank deposits (including
treasury bills and notes), bonds, and loans held to maturity with the purpose of earning periodic
interest, as well as other held-to-maturity investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price
and transaction costs related to the acquisition of the investments. After initial recognition, these /\
investments are recorded at their recoverable amount. Interest income from held-to-maturity
investments after the purchase date is recognized on an accrual basis in the income statement.
Investments in Associates
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence but docs not have
control over the financial and operational policies. Significant influence is the power to
participate in the financial and operational policy decisions of the investee, without having x I
control over those policies.
Investments in associates are initially recognized at cost, which includes the purchase price or
capital contribution plus directly attributable costs related to the investment. In the case of
investments made by non-monetary assets, the investment cost is recorded at the fair value of
the non-monetary assets at the date of the transaction.
Provision for impairment of investments in associates is made when the associate incurs losses.
The provision is equal to the difference between the Company's actual contributed capital in the
associate and the actual equity attributable to the Company’s ownership percentage compared to
the total contributed capital of the associate. If the associate prepares consolidated financial
statements, the basis for determining impairment provisions is the consolidated financial
statements.
Increases or decreases in the provision for impairment of investments in associates must be
recognized at the financial year-end and recorded as finance expenses.

4. Trade Receivables and Other Receivables
Receivables are presented at their carrying amount, less allowance for doubtful debts.. y
Classification of receivables into trade receivables, internal receivables, and other receivables is
made based on the following principles: I
• Trade receivables from customers reflect receivables arising from commercial transactions \^
of purchase and sale between the Company and independent customers, including
receivables from export sales entrusted to other entities.
• Other receivables reflect receivables that are non-commercial and not related to purchase
and sale transactions.
Allowance for doubtful debts is made for each doubtful receivable based on the aging of
overdue debts or expected loss estimates, specifically as follows:
• For overdue receivables:
- 30% of the value for debts overdue from 6 months to less than 1 year.
- 50% of the value for debts overdue from I year to less than 2 years.
- 70% of the value for debts overdue from 2 years to less than 3 years.
- 100% of the value for debts overdue 3 years or more.
• For receivables not yet overdue but considered unlikely to be recovered: allowance is made
based on the estimated loss.
5. Principles of Inventory Recognition (
Inventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value.. (
I
The cost of inventories is determined as follows:
• Raw materials and goods: include purchase costs and other directly attributable costs
incurred to bring the inventories to their current location and condition.
• Finished goods: include costs of raw materials, direct labor, and allocated manufacturing
overheads based on normal operating capacity, as well as direct costs and related overheads
incurred during the construction of real estate finished goods.
• Work in progress: includes only the cost of main raw materials
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventories in the ordinary course of
business, less estimated costs to complete and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Inventory value is calculated using the weighted average cost method and accounted for using
the perpetual inventory system.
Provision for inventory devaluation is made for each inventory item with a cost higher than its
net realizable value. Increases or decreases in the balance of inventory provision must be made
at the end of the financial year and recognized in the cost of goods sold.
6. Principles of Recognition and Depreciation of Fixed Assets

7. Investment Property
Investment property includes land use rights, buildings, parts of buildings, or infrastructure ft
owned by the Company that are held for the purpose of earning rental income or for capital N
appreciation. Investment property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of ^
investment property includes all expenses the Company incurs or the fair valtie of assets given Li
up to acquire the investment property as of the purchase or completion date. _
Subsequent costs related to investment property incurred after initial recognition are expensed
unless they are likely to increase future economic benefits beyond the originally assessed
performance, in which case they are capitalized and added to the cost.
When investment property is sold, its cost and accumulated depreciation arc removed from the
books, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in income or expenses for the year.
Transfers from owner-occupied property or inventories to investment property occur only when
the owner ceases to use the asset and begins leasing it out or when the construction phase is
completed. Transfers from investment property to owner-occupied property or inventories occur
only when the owner begins to use the asset or starts to market it for sale. These transfers do not
change the cost or carrying amount of the property at the transfer date.
Investment properties held for capital appreciation are not depreciated. If there is reliable
evidence that the investment property held for capital appreciation is impaired compared to its 5 p
market value, the carrying amount is reduced accordingly, and the impairment loss is recorded HA
in cost of goods sold. 30^

9. Accounting Principles for Payables and Accrued Expenses
n
Payables and accrued expenses are recognized for amounts expected to be paid in the future
related to goods and services already received. Accrued expenses arc recorded based on
reasonable estimates of the amounts payable.
The classification of payables into trade payables, accrued expenses, and other payables is based
on the following principles:
• Trade payables represent liabilities of a commercial nature arising from the purchase of
goods, services, or assets from third-party suppliers, including amounts payable related to
imported goods through authorized import agents.
• Accrued expenses represent liabilities for goods and services already received from
suppliers or already provided to customers but not yet paid due to the absence of invoices or
incomplete accounting documentation. This also includes liabilities to employees for
accrued leave and other production and business expenses to be accrued.
• Other payables represent liabilities that are non-commercial in nature and not related to the
purchase, sale, or supply of goods and services.
10. Principles for Recognizing Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities
The Company must closely monitor the repayment terms of borrowings and finance lease
liabilities. Obligations with repayment periods exceeding 12 months from the date of the
financial statements are presented by the accounting department as long-term borrowings and
finance lease liabilities. Obligations due within 12 months from the date of the financial
statements arc presented as short-term borrowings and finance lease liabilities to facilitate
repayment planning.
For finance lease liabilities, the total lease obligation recorded on the credit side of account 341
reflects the total amount payable, calculated as the present value of the minimum lease
payments or the fair value of the leased asset, whichever is lower.
11. Principles for Recognizing Accrued Expenses
Payables for goods or services received from suppliers, or provided to customers during the
reporting period but not yet paid due to the absence of invoices or insufficient accounting
documentation, as well as accrued interest expenses on borrowings, arc recognized as expenses
in the production and business operations of the reporting period.
The accounting of accrued expenses into production and business costs during the period must
follow the matching principle between revenues and expenses incurred in the same period.
Actual expenses incurred must be reconciled with the previously accrued amounts, and any
differences shall be either reversed or additionally recorded into expenses accordingly.

The Company has transferred the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership of the
products or goods to the buyer
The Company no longer retains control over the goods nor holds managerial involvement

The amount of revenue can be measured reliably. If the contract allows the buyer to
return products under specific conditions, revenue is only recognized when those
conditions no longer exist and the buyer no longer has the right to return the goods
(except where returns are in exchange for other goods or services).
It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will How to the
Company.

Held-1 o-Mat urity Investments
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and fixed maturities that the Company has the positive intention and ability to hold to
maturity.
Loans and Receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with Fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market.
Available-for-Sale Financial Assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as
available for sale or are not classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or
loss, held-to-maturity investments, or loans and receivables..
Initial Recognition of Financial Assets
Financial assets are recognized on the trade date and derecognized on the settlement date. At
initial recognition, financial assets are measured at purchase price/issue cost plus any directly
attributable transaction costs.
Financial Liabilities
The Company classifies financial liabilities into the following categories: financial liabilities
measured at fair value through profit or loss and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. $
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial liability and is determined
at initial recognition.
Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss ^
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss if they are held
for trading or designated as such at initial recognition. 'a
Financial liabilities are classified as held-for-trading if:
• They are issued or incurred primarily for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term:
• The Company holds them primarily for short-term profit-taking;
• They are derivative financial instruments (except those designated as financial guarantee
contracts or effective hedging instruments)
Financial Liabilities Measured at Amortized Cost
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value, net of
transaction costs, and subsequently measured using the effective interest method. Amortized
cost equals the initial recognition amount minus principal repayments, plus or minus cumulative
amortization of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus
any reduction for impairment or uncollectibility (either directly or through a provision account).
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial
liability or a group of financial liabilities and allocating the interest income or interest expense
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated
future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or. where
appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial liability.
Initial Recognition of Financial Liabilities
At initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured at the issuance price plus any directly
attributable transaction costs related to the issuance of the financial liability.
