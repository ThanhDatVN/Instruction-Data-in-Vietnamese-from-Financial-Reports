Reason for non-payment: The overall economic difficulties have severely impacted the Company's business operations. Additionally, banks have tightened their credit appraisal ending
policies. As a result, when banks stop extending or issuing new credit limits for borrowing businesses, the Company's working capital experiences a significant shortfall, leading to low
payment cash flow. These factors have caused the Company to struggle with meeting its due debt obligations to the bankINDOCHINE IMPORT EXPORT INVESTMENT INDUSTRIALJOINT STOCK COMPANY Consolidated financial statements

3. EVENTS AFTER THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET DATE
There have been no significant events occurring after the consolidated balance sheet date, which would require adjustment or
disclosures to be made in the consolidated financial statements. /.
4. INFORMATION ON GOING CONCERN
As at 30 June 2025, the "Current Liabilities" indicator (code: 310) on the Consolidated balance sheet exceeds the "Current
assets" indicator (code 100) by VND 307.603.5 84.909. Additionally, the "Short-term borrowings and lease Liabilities" indicator
(code: 320) includes an overdue amount of VND 505.597.413.771 that has not yet been settled. This situation reflects a low
current debt repayment capacity, which may impact the company's ability to continue as a going concern. However, the
management is actively negotiating with financial institutions to restructure and extend overdue loans. Additionally, the
company has received commitments from certain major shareholders and creditors to ensure the maintenance of its ongoing
operations.
COMPARATIVE FIGI RES
The comparative figures are those taken from the consolidated financial statements for the year ended as at 31 December 2024
