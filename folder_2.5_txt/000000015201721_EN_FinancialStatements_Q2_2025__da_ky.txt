44. Financial risk management
Financial risks include credit risk, market risk and operation risk.
44.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of customers or counterparties failing to fulfill their obligations with the Bank, leading to financial
loss. Credit risk arises from lending and guarantee activities under various forms.
The Bank is also subject to credit risk through investments in debt securities and other risks in its transaction activities
(transaction risk), including assets in the transaction portfolio that do not belong to the owners’ equity, derivatives and
payment balance with partners.
Credit risk is the most significant risk in the Bank’s business activities, thus the Board of Management has carefully
implemented and monitored the credit risk management. Credit risk management department has been cstablised and
responsible for frequently reporting to the Board of Management and the head of each business unit.
44.1.1 Measurement of credit risk for determining loss and making provision
(a) Loans and guarantees
The measurement of credit risk is done before and during the lending term.
The Bank has developed quantitative model for supporting the measurement of credit risk. The credit rating system is
used in all material credit porfolio and being the foundation for measuring the risks of payment violations before and
during lending term.
Based on such measurements, The Bank has made provisions according to Decree No. 86/2024/ND-CP dated November
7, 2024, measured and categorized its loans and guarantees according to Circular No.31/2024/TT-NHNN dated June 30
2024.

44.1.2 Policies to control and mitigate credit risk
The Bank controls credit risk by setting risk limits (on and off-balance sheet) relating to each customer or group of
customers as stipulated by the State Bank of Vietnam. Additionally, credit risk is controlled through periodically
reviewing groups of mortgaged assets and analyzing the capacity of existing and potential customers to pay the interest
and principal portion of the loans.
The Bank implements some policies and practices to mitigate credit risk. One common method is to hold secured assets.
Types of assets pledged as security for credit granting items include:
- Mortgage for residential real estate; land use rights.
- Pledge for operational assets such as machinery and equipment, inventory, receivables;
For secured loans, the valuation of collateral is independently made by the Bank with the application of specific discount
rates to determine the maximum line of credit. When the fair value of collaterals is reduced, the Bank shall require the
borrowers to mortgage additional assets to maintain the level of safety against the risk of the loans.
The credit risk of commitments including letter of credit, financial guarantee contract arc similar to credit risk of a loan.
L/C requiring presentation of document sets or L/C for trade is the Bank's written commitment to pay the third party for
the amount stipulated by specific terms and conditions, on behalf of its customers and guaranteed by customer's goods ,
hence the risk is lower than direct loans. The issuance of L/C and financial guarantee contract follows the process of
assessing and approving credit as the ones designed for loans and advances granted to customers except when the
customers deposit 100% for related commitments.
44.2 Market risk
Market risk is the risk of losses due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments' future cash flows,
following the change of the market value. Market risk is incurred from the opening position of interest rate, monetary
products and equity instruments. All of these products arc impacted by the fluctuation of the market in general and each
type of market, as well as the change in fluctuation level of the market value such as interest rate risk, currency risk and
other pricing risks.
44.3 The fair value of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities of the Bank are recorded as original cost minus provision for devaluation of assets.
Therefore, the book value of financial assets and liabilities of the Bank may differ from their fair value.
Currently, the Bank has not determined the fair value of all financial assets and liabilities. The Bank shall present the fair
value of those assets and liabilities when there is detailed guidance from the authority.
