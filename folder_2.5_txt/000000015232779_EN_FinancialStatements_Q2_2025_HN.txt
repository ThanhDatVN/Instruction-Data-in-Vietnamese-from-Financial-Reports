than 12 months. Any income earned from the temporary investment of such borrowings shall be
deducted from the cost of the related asset.
For general boiiowings partly used to acquire, construct, or produce qualifying assets, the amount of
borrowing costs eligible for capitalization is determined by applying a capitalization rate to the

average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings that are outstanding during the year,

22. Corporation Income Tax
Corporation income tax expense includes current income tax and defeiTed income tax
Current Income Tax
Current income tax is the amount of tax payable on taxable income for the year. Taxable income

accounting treatments, non-deductible expenses, non-taxable income, and carried-forward tax losses
Deferred Income Tax
Deferred income tax is the amount of corporation income tax payable or recoverable in future
periods arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases. Deferred income tax liabilities are
recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognized only
when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible
temporary differences can be utilized.
The canying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each the period -end and is reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or
part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Previously unrecognized deferred income tax
assets are reassessed at the end of the period and recognized when it becomes probable that future
taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted
or substantively enacted by the end of the period. Deferred income tax is recognized in the income
statement, except when it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recorded in
equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when:
® The Corporation has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax
liabilities; and
o The deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority:
On the same taxable entity; or
- On different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a
net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future
period in which significant amounts of deferred income tax liabilities or assets are expected
to be settled or recovered.
