tax
Reasons :
During the period, the Company was starting to construct new projects, so both
Revenue and Cost of goods sold decreased. The decrease rate of Cost of goods sold is
different from decrease rate of Revenue, leading to an increase in Gross profit on sales and
services rendered this period compared to the previous period.
Financial activity revenue in this period increased compared to the previous period due
to exchange rate differences arising from overseas construction activities.The financial
expenses for this period increased compared to the previous period due to a rise in the
Company's interest expenses. Aggregating the above factors, the net profit from operating
activities in this period increased compared to the previous period.
Other profits decreased compared to the same period last year, as in the second quarterof 2024, the Company generated income from the reversal of warranty provisions lor some
projects.
Combining the above factors, the Profit after corporate income tax increased when
compared to the previous period.
