1. Accounting standards and system:
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Vietnamese
Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Account!ng System forCredit Institutions stipulated by the SBV

requirements may differ in some material respects from International Financial Reporting Standards

subsidiary has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain
benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

accounting policies adopted by the Bank and its subsidiary.

internal profits or losses arising from internal transactions are eliminated when preparing consolidated

2. Foreign currency transactions
All transactions of the Bank and its subsidiary are recorded in original currencies. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than VND are translated into VND at the average of the
buying and selling spot exchange rate of that currency (“spot exchange rate”) ruling at the end of the
last working day of the accounting period if the difference between this spot exchange rate and the
weighted average of the buying and selling exchange rate ruling on the last working day of the
accounting period is less than 1%, in the case of this difference is equal to or greater than 1%, the Bank
uses the weighted average of the buying and selling exchange rate ruling on the last working day of the
accounting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than VND are
translated to VND at spot exchange rates ruling on transaction dates.
The transactions related to income/expenses in foreign currency are converted to VND at the average
buying and selling exchange rate for immediate transfer on the date of the transaction. The exchange
rate differences arising from the revaluation of foreign currency assets and liabilities to VND on the
monthly reporting date are recorded in the "Foreign exchange differences" account on the consolidated

consolidated statement of operating results by the straight-line method during the effective period of
these contracts.
The balance of the currency forward contract is re-evaluated at the spot exchange rate at the end of each
month. Unrealized gains/losses are recorded in the foreign exchange difference on the consolidated
financial position report at the end of each month and are transferred to the consolidated income
statement at the end of the fiscal year.

IX-Financial risk management
38. Risk management related to financial instruments
Risk is always inherent in the Bank’s operation but it is managed by detective procedures, periodical
evaluation and control depending on the risk limit and other existed controls. The risk management
process is critical to the Bank’s profitability and each individual of the Bank has responsibility to prevent
risks relating to their work. The Bank has exposure to risks such as: credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk
(classified as business risk and non-business risk). In addition, the Bank also exposed to operational risk.
The independent risk control process does not take into account business risks such as changes in
environment, technology and industry structure. These risks are controlled by strategy planning process
of the Bank.

first quarter of 2025 ended 31 March 2025 (continued) 49/2014/TT-NHNN dated 31 December 2014)
39. Credit risk
Credit risk is the possibility of loss in the Group's operations due to customers' failure or inability to
perform their obligations as committed.
In order to performing credit risk management, the Bank issued credit policies and instructions to
standardise credit activities of the Bank.
The Bank controls and manages the credit risk by establishing credit limit based on the level of risk that
the Bank can accept with each customer, each geographical area and each industry. The credit limit of
each customer is established by using the credit rating system in which each customer would be classified
at each specific risk level. This level can be changed and updated regularly.
The Bank has established the credit quality review process that allows early prediction of changes in
financial position and credit-worthiness of counterparties based on qualitative and quantitative factors.
40. Market risk
a. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes
in market interest rates. The Bank will expose to interest rate risk when there is a gap between maturity
date or interest repricing date of assets, liabilities and off-statement of financial position commitments in
a specific period of time.
The Bank usually monitors interest rate gaps, compares the domestic market with international market for
timely adjustments. In addition, the application of internal risk management became more effective thanks
to the deployment of Internal Funds Transfer Pricing System and Concentrated Payment System, so that
all capital and payment transactions of the Bank are performed by the Head Office. This helps the Bank
monitor the capital changes and reduce the potential errors as well as the unnecessary complicated
procedures more effectively.
Analysis of assets and liabilities in term of interest repricing period
The interest repricing period is the period from the reporting date to earlier of contractual repricing date
or maturity date of assets and liabilities, depend on which factors come sooner.
The following assumptions and conditions are applied in analysing the interest repricing period of assets
and liabilities of the Bank:
■ Cash on hand; derivatives and other financial assets; long-term investments; other assets (including
fixed assets and other assets) and other liabilities are categorised as interest free.
■ Balances with the SBV are classified as demand deposits so the interest repricing period is categorised
as up to 1 month.
* The actual interest rate reset period of investment securities is calculated based on the actual maturity
period at the end of the fiscal year for each type of security.
■ The interest repricing period of deposits with and loans to other credit institutions; loan to customers;
due to and borrowings from other credit institutions and deposits from customers are defined as follows:
Items with the fixed interest rate during the contract term: the interest repricing period is from the end
of accounting period to maturity date.
Items with the variable interest rate: the interest repricing period is from the end of accounting period
to the earlier of contractual repricing date or maturity date.
* The actual interest rate reset period for issued valuable papers is based on the remaining maturity
period of each type of valuable paper.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank has difficulties in fulfilling its obligations for financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk arises when the Bank does not have ability to fulfil the payment obligations when financial
liabilities are due under both normal and stressed conditions. To reduce the liquidity risk, the Bank has to
mobilise from various capitals besides the basic capital of the Bank has asset management policies which
have flexible liquidity, follow the future cash flows and daily liquidity. The Bank should evaluate the
expected cash flows and available ability of current guaranteed assets in case of mobilising more capital.
Liquidity risk is limited by holding a large amount of cash and cash equivalents under demand deposits
with other credit institutions, balances with the SBV and other credit institutions and valuable papers.
Safety ratio that taken into account risk factor are also used to manage liquidity risk.
The maturity period of assets and liabilities represents the remaining term of the assets and liabilities from
the date of the consolidated financial statements to the payment date as stipulated in the contract or
issuance terms.
The following assumptions and conditions are applied in analysing the maturity of assets and liabilities of
the Bank:
" Balances with the SBV are classified as demand deposits, included compulsory reserve. The balance
of compulsory reserve depends on elements and term of deposits from customers of the Bank.
■ The maturity of due from and loans to other credit institutions, derivatives and other financial assets
and loans to customers are determined based on the contractual maturity date. The actual maturity date
can be changed as the loans contracts are extended.
* The maturity of investment securities is based on the contractual maturity date of each securities.
■ The maturity of long-term equity investments is categorised over 5 years because these investments
do not have exact maturity date and the Bank has intention to hold them in long-term.
■ The maturity of fixed assets is determined by the remaining useful lives of assets.
■ The maturity of due to and boirowings from other credit institutions and deposits from customers is
determined based on the characteristics of each type or the maturity date specified in the contracts.
Demand deposits from other credit institutions and customers are perfonned as requirements of customer
and categorised as call deposits. The maturity for borrowings and term deposits are detennined based on
contractual maturity date. In practice, they can be renewed and therefore the actual maturities of those
assets and liabilities may be longer than the original contractual terms.
