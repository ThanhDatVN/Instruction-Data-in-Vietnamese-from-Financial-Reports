We have reviewed the accompanying interim financial statements of Ben Tre Water
Supply and Sewerage Joint Stock Company (hereafter referred to as “the Company”)
prepared on 4th August 2025, from page 07 to page 33, which comprise the interim
Balance Sheet as at 30lh June 2025, the interim Income Statement, the interim Cash
ặ Flows Statement for the six-month period then ended and the Notes to the interim
Financial Statements.
< The Board of Directors’ responsibility
^ The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of these interim financial statements in accordance with the accounting
standards, Vietnamese enterprises' accounting regime as well as other related
i| regulations and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of interim financial statements that
3 are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim financial information based
4 on our review. We conducted our review in accordance with the Vietnamese Standards
on Review Engagements 2410 - Review of interim financial information performed by
' the independent auditor of the entity.
Bl A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and
other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
IJ in accordance with the Vietnamese Standards and consequently does not enable US to
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be
identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
