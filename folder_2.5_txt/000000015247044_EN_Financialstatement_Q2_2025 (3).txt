2 BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Accounting standards and accounting regime
The accompanying financial statements, expressed in Vietnamese Dong (VND), are prepared
under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards,
accounting regime for enterprises (Circular No. 202/2014/TT-BTC dated December 22, 2014,
issued by the Ministry of Finance, guiding the method of preparing and presenting consolidated
financial statements) and legal regulations relating to financial reporting.
The consolidated financial statements of Thanh Dat Investment and Development Joint Stock
Company are prepared based on the separate financial statements of Thanh Dat Investment
and Development Joint Stock Company (the parent company) and the financial statements of
Tan Cang - Dong Van III Industrial Park Infrastructure Development Investment Joint Stock
Company (the subsidiary). The subsidiary is the entity controlled by the parent company. Control
exists based on direct or indirect power, determining the financial and operational policies of the
enterprise to derive profits from its business activities. The financial statements of the
subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is acquired until the date control is lost.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared based on the aggregation
of the items from the separate financial statements of Thanh Dat Investment and Development
Joint Stock Company and Tan Cang - Dong Van III Industrial Park Infrastructure Development
Investment Joint Stock Company, with the elimination of internal revenue, expenses, and
receivables and payables, along with other adjustments as required by regulations.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are initially recognized at cost.
Subsequently, the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted upward or downward in
accordance with the Company's share of the investee's profits or losses after the investment
date. The Company's share of the investee's results is recognized in the Company's income
statement. Dividends received from the investee must be accounted for as a reduction in the
carrying amount of the investment. Adjustments to the carrying amount must also be made
when the Company's interest changes due to income items recognized directly in the equity of
the investee, such as revaluation of fixed assets or exchange rate differences arising from the
translation of financial statements.
The non-controlling interests are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet as part
of the equity section of the Company. The share of the non-controlling interests in the
consolidated income statement must also be presented as a separate item in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss. The non-controlling interests in the net asset value of the
consolidated subsidiaries include: the non-controlling interests at the acquisition date,
determined by the fair value of the subsidiary's net assets at the acquisition date; the non­
controlling interests in the changes in total equity from the acquisition date to the beginning of
the reporting period; and the non-controlling interests in the changes in total equity arising
during the reporting period. Losses incurred at the subsidiary must be allocated according to the
non-controlling interests' share, even if the losses exceed the non-controlling interests' share of
the subsidiary’s net assets.

4.1. Accounting Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements for the period ended as at 30/06/2025 in
conformity with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, accounting regime for enterprises and legal
regulations relating to financial reporting requires The Board of Directors to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the financial year. Although these accounting estimates are
based on The Board of Directors’s best knowledge, actual results may differ from those
estimates
4.2. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand and bank deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term investments with a maturity or redemption period of no more
than 3 months, which can be easily converted into a known amount of cash and have no
significant risk of changes in value when converted into cash from the date of purchase up to
the reporting date.

Receivables are presented in the financial statements at their carrying amount, which includes
amounts due from customers and other receivables, along with provisions for doubtful debts. At

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form No. B09a-DN/HN
Quarter II of 2025
- Receivables with a collection or settlement period of more than 1 year (or longer than one
production or business cycle) are classified as non-current assets.
Provision for doubtful receivables reflects the estimated loss in value due to receivables that are
expected to be uncollectible, arising from outstanding amounts due from customers as of the
end of the accounting period.
Provision for doubtful receivables is made for receivables that are overdue for six months or
more, or for receivables from customers who are unlikely to pay due to liquidation, bankruptcy,
or similar difficulties (excluding customers who are overdue but are in the process of making
payments or have committed to paying in the near future).
4.4. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads
that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to completion
and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The company applies the perpetual inventory method to account for inventories, with the value
determined as follows:
The value of inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method on a monthly
basis.
Provision for inventory write-down is made for materials and goods in inventory where the cost
exceeds the net realizable value, in accordance with the provisions of Vietnamese Accounting
Standard No. 02 "Inventories" and Circular No. 48/2019/TT-BTC dated August 8, 2019, issued
by the Ministry of Finance, which provides guidelines on the establishment and use of
provisions for inventory write-downs, financial investment losses, doubtful receivables, and
product, goods, construction warranty provisions in enterprises.
4.5. Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Fixed assets are presented at their original cost and accumulated depreciation.
Tangible fixed assets
The original cost of tangible fixed assets includes the purchase price and directly related costs
to bring the asset to a state ready for use. The original cost of self-constructed tangible fixed
assets includes construction costs, actual production costs incurred, plus installation and testing
costs. Costs for upgrading tangible fixed assets are capitalized and added to the asset's original
cost, while maintenance and repair costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
When a tangible fixed asset is sold or disposed of, its original cost and accumulated
depreciation are written off, and any resulting gains or losses from the disposal are recorded in
the operating results of the period.

Quarter II of 2025
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated using the straight-line method, applied to all
assets with a rate determined to allocate the original cost over the estimated useful life, in
accordance with the guidelines set out in Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC dated April 25, 2013,
issued by the Ministry of Finance, which provides instructions on the management, use, and
depreciation of fixed assets. Circular No. 147/2016/TT-BTC dated October 13, 2016, amends
and supplements some provisions of Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC, and Circular No.
28/2017/TT-BTC dated April 12, 2017, further amends and supplements some provisions of
Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC.
The depreciation period for the company's tangible fixed assets is as follows:
Buildings and structures 15-50 years
•>
Machinery and equipment 03 - 08 years
Transportation vehicles 06-10 years
Office equipment 05 years -
Other assets 02 - 05 years
4.6. Financial investments
Long-term financial investments

neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the Company. Significant influence is reflected in the
ability to participate in decisions regarding the policies and operations of the investee but
without having control or joint control over those policies.
4.7. Prepayments
Prepaid expenses include tools and equipment, the value of assets that do not meet the criteria
to be classified as fixed assets (with a value of less than 30 million VND), exploration rights
costs, and other prepaid expenses. These prepaid expenses will be gradually allocated to the
cost of production and business operations over a reasonable period starting from when they
are incurred.
4.8. Payables
Payables are presented in the financial statements at the carrying value of amounts owed to the
Company's creditors and other payables, detailed by each payee. At the reporting date, if:
- Payables with a payment term of less than 1 year (or within a business cycle) are classified
as current liabilities;
- Payables with a payment term of more than 1 year (or more than one business cycle) are
classified as non-current liabilities.
4.9. Accured expenses
Accrued expenses include the value of expenses that have been recognized as business
operating costs during the accounting period but have not yet been paid at the end of the
period. These may include audit fees, construction costs, and other similar expenses. When

amounts should be adjusted, either by increasing or decreasing the expense account based on
the difference.
4.10. Owner’s equity
The principle for recognizing owner’s equity contributions:
Capital is recorded according to the amount actually invested by shareholders.
Retained earnings are the profit from the company's activities after deducting (-) adjustments for
the retrospective application of changes in accounting policies and corrections of material errors
from previous years.
4.11. Revenue
Revenue is recognized when the outcome of the transaction can be reliably determined, and the
Company is likely to receive economic benefits from the transaction.
(i) Revenue from sales is recognized when most of the risks and rewards associated with
the ownership of goods have been transferred to the buyer, and the goods have been
delivered to the buyer and accepted by the customer.
(ii) Revenue from construction is recognized based on the portion of work completed and
confirmed by the customer during the period, when the Company ensures that it will
obtain benefits from the construction contract and the costs to complete the work done at
the financial statement date can be reliably measured.

been transferred to the customer, the service has been provided, and accepted by the
customer.

exchange gains, and other financial income. Interest on deposits and loans is recognized on
an accrual basis, calculated based on the balance of deposits and the applicable interest
rates.

interest payment.
4.12. The principle for recognizing cost of goods sold
The cost of goods sold reflects the value of the products, goods, or services sold during the
period, ensuring alignment with the revenue recognized in the same period.
4.13. Accounting principle for administrative expenses
Business management expenses reflect the general management costs of the Company,
including expenses such as salaries of the management team, social insurance, health insurance,
union fees, unemployment insurance for the company's management staff, office materials, labor
tools, depreciation of fixed assets used for business management, land rental, business license
tax, provision for doubtful debts, outsourced services, and other monetary expenses.

deductible.

outstanding to reflect the effect of potential dilutive common shares, which include convertible
bonds and stock options.

7.5 Financial instruments
The Company is exposed to the following risks when using financial instruments:
- Market Risk
- Credit risk
- Liquidity Risk
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of financial risk management. The Board
of Directors establishes policies to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and
controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to risk limits. The risk management system and policies are reviewed
periodically to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's operations.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees to apply management policies for the above risks as follows:
(i) Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in
market prices. There are four types of market risk: interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk and other price risk.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes
in market interest rates. The Company's exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the
Company's cash, short-term deposits and borrowings.
The Company manages interest rate risk by analyzing the competitive market situation to obtain interest rates that are
favorable to the Company's purposes and still within its risk management limits.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company is exposed to risks due to changes in foreign exchange rates that are
directly related to the Company's business operations.
(ii) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or transaction contract,
leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities and from its financing activities,
including bank deposits, loans and other financial instruments.
Accounts receivable
The Company regularly monitors its outstanding receivables from customers. For major customers, the Company reviews
each customer's credit quality at the reporting date for deterioration. The Company seeks to maintain close control over
outstanding receivables and has a credit control staff to minimize credit risk.
The Company will establish an impairment allowance to reflect the estimated impairment loss for trade receivables, other
receivables and investments. The main component of this impairment allowance is the specific loss related to the specific
impairment loss for each customer.
Bank deposit
The Company mainly maintains its deposits with well-known banks in Vietnam. Credit risk from deposits with banks is
managed by the Company's treasury department in accordance with the Company's policy. The Company's maximum
exposure to credit risk for items on the balance sheet at the end of the financial year is the carrying amount as disclosed in
Note 5.1. The Company considers that the concentration of credit risk in respect of bank deposits is low.
(¡¡¡) Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will have difficulty in fulfilling its financial obligations due to lack of funds. The
Company's liquidity risk arises mainly from the fact that financial assets and financial liabilities have different maturities.
The Company minimizes liquidity risk by maintaining a level of cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings that the
Board of Directors believes is adequate to finance the Company's operations and minimize the risk of fluctuations in cash
flows.
The table below analyses non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities into relevant maturity groups based on the
remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts presented in the table are
undiscounted contractual cash flows. The presentation of information on non-derivative financial assets is necessary for an
understanding of the Company’s liquidity risk management as liquidity is managed on a net asset and liability basis

(*) Regarding the determination of fair value of these financial assets and liabilities for disclosure purposes as prescribed in
Article 28 of Circular 201/2009/TT-BTC dated 6 November 2009 of the Ministry of Finance, because there is no listed market
value for these financial assets and liabilities and Vietnamese Accounting Standards, Vietnamese Accounting System does
not have guidance on how to calculate fair value in case there is no listed market value, the Company has not determined the
fair value of these financial assets and liabilities for disclosure purposes.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities was not formally assessed and determined as of 30 June 2025 and 1 January
2025. However, the Management has assessed that the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities does not differ
materially from their carrying amounts as of the financial reporting date.
