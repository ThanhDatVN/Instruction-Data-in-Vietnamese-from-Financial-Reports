IV. Applicable Accounting Policies
1. Monetary exchange
The exchange rate used to record transactions of buying and selling foreign currencies is the actual buying and selling
rate at the time economic and financial transactions arise.
The exchange rate used to record other business in foreign currency for VND conversion: The average spot exchange
rates (buying and selling) of that foreign currency as on the date of the transactions made.
Closing balance of monetary items denominated in foreign currencies must be revaluated at the spot exchange rate at
the end of the last working day of the reporting period, if this exchange rate is 1% less than the weighted average rate
of buying and selling exchange rate as at the last working day of the reporting period. If this exchange rate is 1%
above the weighted average rate of buying and selling exchange rate as at the last working day of the reporting period,
then the mentioned weighted average exchange rate is applied.
Foreign exchange rate differences upon the generated transactions and revaluation of closing balance of monetary
items denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in. the Income Statement in the period.

35.806 VND/GBP 32.650 VND/CHF
2. Principles for consolidating the financial statements
Subsidiary' is a company which the Bank has the power over to govern the financial and operating policies. The
subsidiary's financial statements are consolidated into the Bank's since the date the Bank holds control over the
subsidiary and are no longer consolidated since the Bank ceases its control right. ^.
The Bank records business combination using purchase method. The purchase cost includes the fair value at the date
of exchanging assets, equity instruments issued by the purchaser and liabilities incurred or recognized plus directly1! -ol'
I* i
expenses related to the purchase of the subsidiary.
Intra-company balances, transactions and unrealized profit between the subsidiary and the Bank have been eliminated
when the consolidated financial statements are prepared. The unrealized loss has been eliminated too, except the case
where the transactions indicate the devaluation of the handed-over assets. The accounting policies that the subsidiary
applies have to be changed when neccessary, to assure the consistency with those applied by the Bank.
3. Derivative for financial instruments and provision for losses
Derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at the contract value on the transaction
date and then revaluated at month end foreign exchange rate. The profit or loss after the derivative financial
instruments realized are recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement. Unrealized profit or loss is recorded in the
foreign exchange difference item of the balance sheet at the month end and shall be transferred to the Consolidated
Income Statement at the year end.
4. Accounting for interest income, interest expenses and termination of interest accruals
The Bank records interest income and interest expenses by accrual method on daily basis. Interests on overdue loans
are not recorded on accrual basis, but in the off- balance sheet. When a loan item becomes overdue, the accrued
interest shall be reversed and recorded in the off-balance sheet. The interests of overdue loans shall be recorded in the
Consolidated Income Statement once they are collected.

determined by considering the whole group of obligations in general. Provision shall be made though the economic
benefit outflow because liability settlement is very small.

reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and specific risk exposure to the liability. The
increase of provision throughout time shall be recorded as interest expense.

43. Financial risk management
Financial risks include credit risk, market risk and operation risk.
43.1 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of customers or counterparties failing to fulfill their obligations with the Bank, leading to financial loss.
Credit risk arises from lending and guarantee activities under various forms.
The Bank is also subject to credit risk through investments in debt securities and other risks in its transaction activities
(transaction risk), including assets in the transaction portfolio that do not belong to the owners' equity, derivatives and
payment balance with partners.
Credit risk is the most significant risk in the Bank's business activities, thus the Board of Management has carefully
implemented and monitored the credit risk management. Credit risk management department has been establised and
responsible for frequently reporting to the Board of Management and the head of each business unit.
43.1.1 Measurement of credit risk for determining loss and making provision
(a) Loans and guarantees
The measurement of credit risk is done before and during the lending term.
The Bank has developed quantitative model for supporting the measurement of credit risk. The credit rating system is used in
all material credit porfolio and being the foundation for measuring the risks of payment violations before and during lending
term.
Based on such measurements, the Bank has made provisions according to Decree No. 86/2024/ND-CP dated November 7,
2024. measured and categorized its loans and guarantees according to Circular No.31/2024/TT-NHNN dated June 3 0 2024.

For fiscal period starting from January 01, 2025, to June 30, 2025 VND Million
(b) Debt securities
Investments of the Bank in debt securities arc debts instruments issued by the Government and reputable credit, economic
institutions. Credit risk is estimated by each specific debt in case the Bank assumes that there is credit risk change of its
counterparties. These investments are considered as a way to ensure a better credit plan and maintain available credit sources
for meeting requirements of capital supply.
43.1.2 Policies to control and mitigate credit risk
The Bank controls credit risk by setting risk limits (on and off-balance sheet) relating to each customer or group of customers
as stipulated by the State Bank of Vietnam. Additionally, credit risk is controlled through periodically reviewing groups of
mortgaged assets and analyzing the capacity of existing and potential customers to pay the interest and principal portion of
the loans.
The Bank implements some policies and practices to mitigate credit risk. One common method is to hold secured assets.
Types of assets pledged as security for credit granting items include:
- Mortgage for residential real estate; land use rights.
- Pledge for operational assets such as machinery and equipment, inventory, receivables;
For secured loans, the valuation of collateral is independently made by the Bank with the application of specific discount
rates to determine the maximum line of credit. When the fair value of collaterals is reduced, the Bank shall require the
borrowers to mortgage additional assets to maintain the level of safety against the risk of the loans.
The credit risk of commitments including letter of credit, financial guarantee contract are similar to credit risk of a loan. L/C
requiring presentation of document sets or L/C for trade is the Bank's written commitment to pay the third party for the
amount stipulated by specific terms and conditions, on behalf of its customers and guaranteed by customer's goods , hence the
risk is lower than direct loans. The issuance of L/C and financial guarantee contract follows the process of assessing and
approving credit as the ones designed for loans and advances granted to customers except when the customers deposit 100%
for related commitments.
43.2 Market risk
Market risk is the risk of losses due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments' future cash flows, following
the change of the market value. Market risk is incurred from the opening position of interest rate, monetary products and
equity instruments. All of these products are impacted by the fluctuation of the market in general and each type of market, as
well as the change in fluctuation level of the market value such as interest rate risk, currency risk and other pricing risks.
43.3 The fair value of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities of the Bank are recorded as original cost minus provision for devaluation of assets. Therefore,
the book value of financial assets and liabilities of the Bank may differ from their fair value.
Currently, the Bank has not determined the fair value of all financial assets and liabilities. The Bank shall present the fair
value of those assets and liabilities when there is detailed guidance from the authority.
