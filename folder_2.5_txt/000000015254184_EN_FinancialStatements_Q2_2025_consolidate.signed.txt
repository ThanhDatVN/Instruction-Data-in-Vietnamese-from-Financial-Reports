3. ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND POLICIES (continued)
3.3. Basis of consolidation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Bank and its
subsidiaries for the accounting period from 01 January 2025 to 30 June 2025. Subsidiaries are
fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Bank obtains control,
and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. In case the Bank divests
its equity interest in a subsidiary resulting in loss of control over the subsidiary, the Bank only
consolidates the financial result of the subsidiary from the beginning of the period up to the date of
the divestment without consolidating the net assets of the subsidiary. Furthermore, the Bank
makes adjustments of indirect impact of the divestment transactions on the consolidated cash flow
statement.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent
company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-company balances, income and expenses and unrealized gains or losses result from intra-
company transactions are eliminated in full.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of the profit or loss and net assets not held by the
Bank and are presented separately in the consolidated income statement and within equity in the
consolidated statement of financial position.
3.4. Basis of assumptions and uses of estimates
The presentation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Board of Management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported
amounts of income, expenses, and provisions. These estimates are based on assumptions about
several factors with varying degrees of subjectivity and uncertainty. Therefore, actual results may
differ, leading to adjustments to the related items in the future.
3.5. Accounting policies for items under the Restructuring Plan for the period 2023-2025 and
the orientation towards 2030
Implementing the "Scheme for Restructuring the System of Credit Institutions in Association with
Handling Bad Debts for the 2021-2025 Period" issued under Decision No. 689/QD-TTg dated 08

4.8. Investment securities (continued)
4.8.3. Measurement
Debt securities are initially stated at cost, including transaction costs and other directly attributable
costs. They are subsequently recognized at amortized cost (affected by premium/discount
amortization) less provision for credit risk and diminution. Premium and discounts arising from
purchases of debt securities are amortized to the separate income statement on a straight-line
basis from the acquisition date to the maturity date.
Post-acquisition interest income of available-for-sale debt securities and held-to-maturity debt
securities is recognized in the separate income statement on an accrual basis. The accrued
interest before the Bank purchases debt securities will be deducted from the value of the accrued
interest account when received.
Provision for diminution in value of securities is made when the carrying value is higher than the
market value in compliance with Circular No. 48/2019/TT-BTC dated 08 August 2019 (“Circular
48”), as amended and supplemented by Circular No. 24/2022/TT-BTC dated 07 April 2022
("Circular 24") issued by the Ministry of Finance. Provision for diminution is recognized in the "Net
gain/(loss) from investment securities" item of the separate income statement.
For Government bonds, Government-guaranteed bonds and municipal bonds, the Bank does not
make provisions for these investments.
For corporate bonds that are listed, registered for transactions, the market price of bonds is the
latest transaction price at the Stock Exchange within 10 days to the balance sheet date. If there is
no transaction within 10 days to the balance sheet date, no provision is calculated for these
investments.
The Bank is required to make provision for credit risk for corporate bonds (including bonds issued
by other Cis) which have not yet been listed on stock exchanges or have not yet been registered
for trading on the UPCoM trading system under Circular 31 and Decree 86 as described in Note
4.6.
Other unlisted debt securities (excluding unlisted corporate bonds mentioned above) are stated at
cost less provision for diminution in value determined by market value of securities. If there is no
market value or market value cannot be determined reliably, these securities will be recognized at
their carrying amount.
Provision for investment securities will be reversed when a subsequent increase in the recoverable
amount of the investment securities is due to an objective event occurring after the provision is
recognized. Provision is reversed only up to the carrying amount of these securities before
provision has been made.
4.8.4. De-recognition
Investment securities are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from these
securities expired or when the substantial risks and rewards of ownership of these securities have
been transferred.

4.9. Special Bonds Issued by VAMC
Special bonds issued by VAMC are valued papers with a specific term, issued by VAMC to
purchase non-performing loans from the Bank, and are recognized as held-to-maturity debt
securities.
These special bonds are recorded at par value on the transaction date and are reflected at par
value less specific provisions during the holding period.
The par value of special bonds corresponds to the outstanding principal balance of the non­
performing loan after deducting any unused specific provisions already made for that non­
performing loan.
Specific provisions for special bonds are made based on the Bank's financial capacity up to the
year 2030, according to the restructuring plan approved by competent authorities. The Bank
periodically reports its progress to the State Bank.
4.10. Other long-term investments
Other long-term investments represent investments in other entities in which the Bank holds less
than or equal to 11 % of voting rights. These investments are initially recorded at cost at the
investment date and recognized subsequently at cost less provision for diminution in the value of
other long-term investments (if any).
in cases where the shares of the invested entities are registered for trading on the Unlisted Public
Company Market (UPCoM), provisions for impairment are made when the actual market price, ’
determined as the average reference price over the 30 consecutive trading days before the
financial statement date as announced by the Stock Exchange, is lower than the cost of the f
investment. If the shares of the joint-stock company registered for trading on the UPCoM have no jJ
transactions within 30 days before the financial statement date, the Bank determines the provision |
level for each investment according to the regulations similar to the cases of other investments
below.
Accordingly, at the time of preparing the consolidated financial statements and/or at the end of the
Bank's fiscal year, if the investments in economic organizations have decreased in value compared
to the investment value, the Bank makes provisions for these investments according to Clause 2,
Article 5 of Circular 48.
Based on the consolidated financial statements of the invested economic organization prepared at
the same time as the Bank's consolidated financial statements, provisions for each unlisted
investment or registered on the UPCoM are calculated according to the following formula:
Parties' actual
Actual rate of charter

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred
income tax liability is provided for all temporary differences; deferred income tax asset is only
provided when there is enough taxable profit in the future for deducting the temporary differences
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets must be reassessed at each reporting date and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to
allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax assets to be utilized. The unrecognized deferred
tax assets will be reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has
become probable future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be utilized.
The deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement except when it relates to items
recognized directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the
same taxable entity and the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The tax amounts payable to the State budget will be finalized with the tax office. Differences
between the tax amounts payable specified in the book and the tax amounts under finalization will
be adjusted when the tax finalization has been issued by the tax office.

and risks that are distinguishable from those of the other segments. The Bank's primary segment
is reported on a geographic basis. The Bank's secondary segment is reported on a business line
basis. Currently, the Bank primarily operates in the banking business, which involves the regular
conduct of the following activities: accepting deposits, granting credit, providing payment services,
and other banking activities. Accordingly, the Executive Board is of the opinion that the Bank has

in this single business line. Therefore, the Bank does not need to present detailed segment reports
by business line.

combination is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange plus any costs directly attributable to the business
combination. Identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business
combination are measured initially at fair values at the date of business combination.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost being the excess of the
cost the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquirer’s
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of a business combination is less
than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly
in the consolidated income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less
any accumulated amortization. Goodwill is amortized over five-year period on a straight-line basis.

Current Corporate Income Tax
The current corporate income tax ("CIT") payable is determined based on the taxable income for
the current period. Taxable income differs from the income reported in the consolidated income
statement because taxable income excludes income items that are taxable or deductible in
different periods due to differences between the Bank's accounting policies and current tax
regulations, and it also excludes items that are non-taxable or non-deductible for tax purposes.
The Bank's current corporate income tax payable is calculated at the tax rates that have been
enacted by the end of the accounting period.
The Bank's tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities. As the application of tax laws
and regulations can be interpreted in various ways, the tax amounts presented in the consolidated
financial statements may be subject to changes according to the final decision of the tax authorities.
The current corporate income tax rate of the Bank is 20% (2024: 20%).

35. RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
This section provides details on the risks that the Bank may encounter related to financial
instruments and describes in detail the policies and methods the Bank uses to control these risks.
The most significant financial risks that the Bank may face related to financial instruments include:
- Credit risk;
- Market risk;
- Liquidity risk.
35.1. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a party involved in a financial instrument or contract, such as a customer,
fails to fulfill their obligations, resulting in financial loss. Credit risk arises from lending and
guaranteeing activities in various forms.
The Bank also faces other credit risks arising from investments in debt securities and other risks
in the Bank's trading activities ('transaction risk'), including non-equity trading portfolio assets,
derivatives, and settlement balances with counterparties.
The Bank maintains a credit risk management policy that ensures the following fundamental
principles: establishing an appropriate credit risk management environment; operating under a
sound credit granting process; maintaining an appropriate credit administration, measurement, and
monitoring process; and ensuring adequate control over credit risk.
35.2. Market risk
Market risk is the risk of adverse fluctuations and changes in market risk factors (including interest
rates, exchange rates, securities prices, and commodity prices on the market, etc.) that negatively
impact the Bank's income and capital. Market risk arises from open positions in interest rates,
currency products, and equity instruments, all of which are affected by general market movements
and specific market changes, as well as changes in the volatility of market prices such as interest
rate risk, currency risk, and other price risks.

35.2. Market risk (continued)
35 .2.1. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises when there is a difference of term in repricing of interest rate between
assets and liabilities. All credit activities, mobilization activities, investment activities of the Bank
arise interest rate risk.
On the basis of the state of “interest rate sensitivity” according to periodic changes in interest rates,
the items which are assets, equity and off-balance sheet assets are classified by terms into the
table “interest gap” of the Bank.
Interest rate repricing terms for items with fixed interest rates are the remaining period until maturity
date of assets, as for floating interest rates are the remaining period until the nearest repricing
date.
The followings assumptions and conditions are applied when constructing “interest gap” table;
► Cash and gold, capital contribution, long-term investments, fixed assets, other assets and other
liabilities are classified as “Non-sensitive to interest rate” items;
► The interest rate repricing terms for trading securities and investment securities are determined
based on the remaining contractual maturity at the date of the consolidated financial statements
if such securities have a fixed interest rate, or based on the interest rate repricing terms if such
securities have a floating interest rate;
► The interest rate repricing terms for trading securities and investment securities are determined
based on the remaining contractual maturity at the date of the consolidated financial statements
if such securities have a fixed interest rate, or based on the interest rate repricing terms if such
securities have a floating interest rate;
► The interest rate repricing terms for deposits and Ioans to the SBV and other Cis; derivative
financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities; loans to customers; deposits and
borrowings from the Gorvenment and SBV; deposits and borrowings from other Cis; and
deposits from customers are determined as follows:
- For items with a fixed interest rate throughout the term of the contract: the actual interest
rate repricing term is based on the actual maturity date calculated from the date of the
consolidated financial statements;
- For items with a floating interest rate: the actual interest rate repricing term is based on the
most recent interest rate repricing term calculated from the date of the consolidated financial
statements;
- For demand deposits: the interest rate repricing term will correspond to the stability of the
demand deposit portfolio over time, based on the results of analyzing the behavior of this
portfolio in a moderately stressful scenario;
► The interest rate repricing term for the issuance of securities is based on the contractual
payment/maturity period of each type of security if the security has a fixed interest rate or based
on the contractual interest rate repricing terms if it is a floating rate.

35.2.2. Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments fluctuates due to exchange rate
movements. The Bank was established and operates in Vietnam with the Vietnamese Dong as its
functional currency. The Bank's primary transaction currency is also the Vietnamese Dong. The
Bank's loans and advances to customers are mainly in Vietnamese Dong and US Dollars.
However, some of the Bank's other assets are in foreign currencies other than Vietnamese Dong
and US Dollars. The Bank has established position limits for each currency. Currency positions are
monitored daily, and hedging strategies are used by the Bank to ensure that currency positions are
maintained within the established limits.
Exchange rates of significant foreign currencies against VND as at the reporting date are presented
at Note 37.

35. RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
35.2. Market risk (continued)
35.2.3. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may be unable to fulfill its payment obligations related to
financial liabilities when they become due, particularly in the absence of alternative capital sources
when customers withdraw funds. The consequences could include the Bank's inability to pay
depositors or meet its lending commitments. The Bank manages liquidity risk through the following
strategies:
► Controlling the capital mobilization and loan on daily basis;
► Maintaining investment portfolio securities that are easily convertible to cash;
► Controlling liquidity indices in the financial status report in compliance with the regulations of
the State Bank of Vietnam.
The maturity of assets and liabilities represents the remaining term of the assets and liabilities from
the time of preparing the financial statements until the final payment as stipulated in the contract
or issuance terms.
The following assumptions and conditions are applied in analyzing the maturity of the Bank's assets
and liabilities:
► Balances with the SBV are classified as demand deposits, including compulsory deposits. The
level of compulsory deposits depends on the composition and terms of the Bank's deposits from
customers;
► The maturity term of trading securities and investment securities is based on their individual
maturity dates. Government securities, although classified as long-term, are highly liquid and
can be easily converted to cash. The maturity of equity securities in subsidiaries is determined
by the business plan;
► The maturity term of deposits and loans to other Cis, as well as loans to customers, is based
on contractual maturity dates. However, actual maturity dates may vary due to loan extensions
or prepayments;
► Equity investments are generally considered to have a maturity of more than five (5) years due
to their indefinite nature;
► The maturity terms of deposits and borrowings from other Cis, deposits from customers,
borrowings from Government and the SBC and other assets are determined based on their
specific characteristics or contractual terms. The maturity term of demand deposits is based on
customer behavior analysis, while the maturity term of term deposits and loans is based on
contractual maturity dates;
► The maturity term of fixed assets is determined by their remaining useful life;
► The maturity term of issued securities is based on their individual maturity dates;
► The maturity term of other liabilities is classified based on their actual individual maturity dates.
