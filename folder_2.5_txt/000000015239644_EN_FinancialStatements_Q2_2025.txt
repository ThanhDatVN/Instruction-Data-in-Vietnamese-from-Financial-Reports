Investment in Subsidiaries

policy decisions of the investee but does not affect control or co-control over these policies.
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures or associate companies are initially recorded at
historical costs, which includes the purchase price or capital contribution plus direct investment :
expenses. In the case of investments with non-monetary assets, the cost of the investment is
recorded at the fair value of the non-monetary assets at the arising time.

decrease in value of such investment. Dividends and profits for the periods after the investment
is purchased and recorded as revenue. Dividends are received in shares and are only tracked by ;
the increased number of shares, do not record the value of shares received/recorded at par value.
