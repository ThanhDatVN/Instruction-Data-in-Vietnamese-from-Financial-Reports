The Group primarily operates in the manufacturing and trading of garment products. The company does not prepare segment financial statements by
business segment in accordance with the guidance of Vietnamese Accounting Standard No. 28 "Segment Reporting".

5. Company Risk Management
The Company's main financial liabilities include borrowings, payables to suppliers, and other payables. The primary purpose of these financial liabilities
is to raise capital for the Company's operations. The Company has financial assets such as receivables from customers and other receivables, cash and
cash equivalents, investments in listed and unlisted securities arising directly from the Company's operations.
The key risks arising from the Company's financial instruments are market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
Risk management is an integral part of the Company's entire business operations. The Company has established a control system to ensure an
appropriate balance between the cost of risk and the cost of risk management. The Board of Directors continuously monitors the Company's risk
management process to ensure an appropriate balance between risk and risk control.
The Company's Managent has reviewed and agreed to apply the following risk management policies:
5.1. Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk
includes three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk, and price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings,
corporate bonds, convertible bonds, deposits, and financial investments
The sensitivity analyses presented below are prepared based on the net debt values, with the ratio between fixed-rate debt and floating-rate debt
remaining unchanged
a. Currency Risk
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The
Company's foreign exchange risk is mainly related to its operations (when revenue or expenses are denominated in a currency other than the functional
currency).
Currency Sensitivity
As the company was established and operates in Vietnam with the reporting currency being Vietnamese Dong, the main transaction currency of the q p
Company is also Vietnamese Dong. Therefore, the Company's foreign exchange risk is insignificant At the end of the reporting period, the Company had o
an insignificant balance in foreign currencies, so the Company did not perform a sensitivity analysis for foreign currency. AH
b. Interest Rate
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Ap.7
The Company's interest rate risk relates primarily to cash, short-term deposits, and borrowings.
The Company manages interest rate risk by analyzing market conditions to obtain the most favorable interest rates while remaining within its risk
management limits.
The Company did not perform a sensitivity analysis for interest rates because the risk from changes in interest rates at the reporting date
c. Price Risk
Equity Price Risk;
Listed and unlisted equities held by the Company are affected by market risks arising from the uncertainty of the future value of the investment shares,

Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument or transaction will fail to meet its obligations, resulting in a financial loss. The Company has
credit risk from its business operations primarily relating to customer receivables and from financing activities including bank deposits, foreign
exchange, and other financial instruments.

The Company mitigates credit risk by only dealing with financially sound entities, and the accounts receivable staff regularly monitors receivables co
expedite collection. On this basis, the Company's receivables relate to a large number of different customers, so credit risk is not concentrated on one
customer
b. Bank deposits
The Company primarily maintains deposit balances with well-known banks in Vietnam. Credit risk relating to deposit balances with banks is managed by
the Company's treasury department in accordance with Company policy. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk with respect to bank
deposits to be low.

and short-term receivables and assets. The Company considers the concentration of liquidity risk with respect to meeting financial obligations to be low

sufficient to meet the Company's operational needs to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in cash flows.
