INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To: THE SHAREHOLDERS, THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND THE GENERAL DIRECTOR
BETON 6 CORPORATION
We have audited the accompanying Financial Statements of Beton 6 Corporation (hereinafter referred to as
“the Corporation”), which were prepared on 12 May 2025 (from page 07 to page 41), including the Balance
Sheet as of 31 December 2024, the Income Statement, the Cash Flow Statement for the fiscal year then
ended and the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Responsibility of the General Director
The Corporation’s General Director is responsible for the preparation, true and fair presentation of these
Financial Statements in accordance with the Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise lr''
Accounting System and relevant statutory requirements on the preparation and presentation of the U*( i
Financial Statements; and responsible for such internal control as the Corporation’s General Director V>\
determines necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of Financial Statements to be free from \$<
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Responsibilities of Auditors
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply
with ethical standards and requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
Financial Statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and true
and fair presentation of the Financial Statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Company’s General Director, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the Financial Statements.
We believe that the audit evidences we have obtained are sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our qualified audit opinion.
Basis for qualified audit opinion
We have not been able to obtain adequate and appropriate audit evidence related to some balances with the
carrying values as follows:
Ending balance Beginning balance
- Short-term trade payables VND 49.327.422.535 VND 41.160.958.306
- Short-term advances from customers VND 56.564.809.727 VND 44.533.680.753

Qualified opinion of Auditors
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the “Basis for qualified audit opinion”
paragraph, the Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the financial
position as of 31 December 2024 of Beton 6 Corporation, its financial performance and its cash flows for the
fiscal year then ended, in conformity with the Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise
Accounting System and relevant statutory requirements on the preparation and presentation of the Financial
Statements.
Emphasis of matters
Without qualifying our opinion above, we would like to draw the readers’ attention to Note No. VII.3 in the
Notes to the Financial Statements regarding the net loss of VND 76.938.290.388 in the fiscal year ended 31
December 2024 and its accumulated loss up to 31 December 2024 was VND 1.395.780.261.007, exceeding
its owner’s capital by VND 993.881.375.870. Additionally, as of 31 December 2024, the Corporation’s
current liabilities exceeded its current assets by an amount of VND 1.123.578.585.228. These conditions,
along with other matters presented in Note No. VII.3, show the existence of material uncertainties that can
cause significant doubt on the Corporation’s ability to continue as a going-concern.
