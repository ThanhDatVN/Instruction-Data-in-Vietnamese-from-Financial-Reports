For the fiscal period ended 30lh June 2025
In the event that general borrowings are partly used for the acquisition, construction or production of
an asset in progress, the costs eligible for capitalization will be determined by applying the

transactions can be fairly and truly reflected.
16. Corporate income tax
Corporate income tax includes current income tax and deferred income tax.

different from accounting profit due to the adjustments of temporary differences between tax and
accounting figures, non-deductible expenses as well as those of non-taxable income and losses brought
forward.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is the amount of corporate income tax payable or refundable due to temporary
differences between book values of assets and liabilities serving the preparation of the Financial
Statements and the values for tax purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all the
temporary taxable differences. Deferred income tax assets are recorded only when there is an
assurance on the availability of taxable income in the future against which the temporarily deductible
differences can be used.
Y
Carrying values of deferred corporate income tax assets are considered as of the balance sheet date and
N
will be reduced to the rate that ensures enough taxable income against which the benefits from part of
or all of the deferred income tax can be used. Deferred corporate income tax assets, which have not G
been recorded before, are considered as of the balance sheet date and are recorded when there is
certainly enough taxable income to use these unrecognized deferred corporate income tax assets.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are determined at the estimated rate to
be applied in the year when the assets are recovered or the liabilities are settled based on the effective
tax rates as of the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is recognized in the Income Statement. In
the case that deferred income tax is related to the items of the owner’s equity, corporate income tax
will be included in the owner’s equity.
The Company shall offset deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if:
• The Company has the legal right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax
liabilities; and
• Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are relevant to corporate income tax
which is under the management of one tax authority either:
