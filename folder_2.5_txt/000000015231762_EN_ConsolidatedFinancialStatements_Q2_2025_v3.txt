Re: Explanation of the Consolidated Financial Ha Noi, July^, 2025
Statements for 02 2025 Compared to the Same
Period Last Year
To: - The State Securities Commission (SSC)
- Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX)
First of all, Vinafco Joint Stock Company (VFC) would like to extend our sincere
thanks and best regards to the State Securities Commission (SSC) and the Hanoi Stock
Exchange (HNX).
In the consolidated financial statements for Q2 2025, the Net profit after tax of VFC
decreased by VND 4.6 billion compared to the same period last year. The Company hereby
provides the following explanation for the main reason:
• Gross profit from business activities decreased compared to the same period last
year due to a decline in profitability in the transportation and warehousing service
sectors.
• General administrative expenses increased compared to the same period last year
due to an increase in labor expenses.
This explanation is provided to help the regulatory authorities and investors better
understand the Company’s business performance.
Thank you very much!
