Other activities
Income from other activities of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries is required to pay corporate
income tax at the rate of 20% (for the previous period, the tax rate was 20%).
Taxable profit might differ from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years (including loss carried
forward, if any) and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax expenses reflect the excess of reverted deferred tax assets and arisen deferred tax
assets.
Deferred tax is recognized on significant differences between carrying amounts and the corresponding
tax bases of assets and liabilities in the financial statements, tax losses, and unused tax incentives,
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets
are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset realized, Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss in the income
statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in this case, the
deferred tax is also recorded directly to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net
basis.
The determination of the taxes borne by the Company is based on the current interpretation of tax
regulations, However, these regulations are subject to periodic variation and their ultimate
determination depends on the results of the tax authorities' examinations.
Other taxes are paid in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in Vietnam.

investment is recognized directly in "Retained earnings after tax" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
