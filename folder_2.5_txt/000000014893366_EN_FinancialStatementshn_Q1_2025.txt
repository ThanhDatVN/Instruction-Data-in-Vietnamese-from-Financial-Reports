reference to the specific costs incurred on the property sold and an allocation of any non­
specific costs based on the relative size of the property sold.
Other inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost incurred in bringing each product to its present
location and condition, and net realizable value.
Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business
less the estimated costs to complete and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

Merchandise - cost of purchase on a weighted average basis
Tools and supplies - cost of purchase on a weighted average basis
Provision for obsolete inventories
An inventory provision is created for the estimated loss arising due to the impairment of
value (through diminution, damage, obsolescence, etc.) of raw materials, finished goods,
and other inventories owned by the Company, based on appropriate evidence of impairment
available at the balance sheet date.
Increases or decreases to the provision balance are recorded into the cost of goods sold
account in the consolidated income statement. When inventories are expired, obsolescence,
damage or become useless, the difference between the provision previously made and the

When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an
insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset but only when the
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the
consolidated income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current
pretax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized
as a finance expense.
3.16 Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than the Group’s reporting currency (VND) are recorded at
the actual transaction exchange rates at transaction dates which are determined as follows:
► Transaction resulting in receivables are recorded at the buying exchange rates of the
commercial banks designated for collection;
► Transactions resulting in liabilities are recorded at the selling exchange rates of the
commercial banks designated for payment; and
At the end of the period, monetary balances denominated in foreign currencies are
translated at the actual transaction exchange rates at the balance sheet dates which are
determined as follows:
► Monetary assets are translated at buying exchange rate of the commercial bank where
the Group conduct transactions regularly; and
► Monetary liabilities are translated at selling exchange rate of the commercial bank
where the Group conduct transactions regularly.
All foreign exchange differences incurred are taken to the consolidated income statement.

Dividends
Final dividends proposed by the Group’s Board of Directors are classified as an allocation of
undistributed earnings within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet, until they
have been approved by the Group’s shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. When
these dividends have been approved by the shareholders and declared, they are recognized
as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet.

associated with the ownership of the property have been transferred to the buyer.
Periodic rental income
Rental income arising from operating leases is recognized in the consolidated income
statement on a straight line basis over the terms of the lease.
Rental income recognized one time
For lease of assets which the Group receives rental fee in advance for many periods and
the lease periods cover more than 90% of the useful life of the assets, rental income is

conditions are met:
- The lessee is not entitled to cancel the lease contract and the Group has no obligation to
repay the amount received in advance in all cases and in all forms;
- The amount received in advance from the lease is not less than 90% of the total rental
amount expected to be fulfilled under the contract during the lease term and the lessee
must pay the entire amount of lease within 12 months from the beginning of the lease;

transferred to the lessee; and
- The Group must estimate relatively the full cost of the lease.

to the completed work, where the outcome of a construction contract can be determined
reliably and accepted by the customers, revenue and costs are recognized by reference to
the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date which is accepted
by the customers and reflected in the sales invoices.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that
they have been agreed with the customer.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract

3.21 Taxation
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at
the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates
and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted as at the balance
sheet date.
Current income tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except
when it relates to items recognized directly to equity, in which case the current income tax is
also dealt with in equity.
Current income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right
for the Group to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the Group
intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance
sheet date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for
financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:
► where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in
a transaction which at the time of the related transaction affects neither the accounting
profit nor taxable profit or loss;
► in respect of taxable temporarily differences associated with investments in subsidiaries
and associates, and interests in joint ventures where timing of the reversal of the
temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward
unused tax credit and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit
will be available against which deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax
credit and unused tax losses can be utilized, except:
► where the deferred tax asset in respect of deductible temporary difference which arises
from the initial recognition of an asset or liability which at the time of the related
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
► in respect of deductible temporarily differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are
recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will
reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the
temporary differences can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each consolidated balance sheet
date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will
be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Previously
unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each balance sheet date and are
recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the
deferred tax assets to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply
in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax
laws that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax (continued)
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except when it
relates to items recognized directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt
with in the equity account.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right for the
Group to off-set current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on:
► either the same taxable entity; or
► when the Group intends either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis
or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in
which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled
or recovered.
3.22 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit after tax for the
period attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company (after adjusting the bonus and
welfare fund) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the
period.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit after tax
attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company (after adjusting interest on the
convertible preference shares) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that
would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary
shares.
3.23 Related parties
Parties are considered to be related parties of the Group if one party has the ability to
control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making
financial and operating decisions, or when the Group and other party are under common
control or under common significant influence. Related parties can be enterprise or
individual, including close members of the family of any such individual.

41. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the
Group’s risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products
and services produced. The operating businesses are organized and managed separately
according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment
representing a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different
markets.
The Group is principally engaged in the development of industrial parks and in residential
parks, infrastructure, electricity, warehouses and offices, and rendering of related services.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner
similar to transactions with third parties. Segment revenue, segment expense and segment
result include transfers between business segments. Those transfers are eliminated in
preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements.
The Group operates in one geographical segment which is Vietnam.
