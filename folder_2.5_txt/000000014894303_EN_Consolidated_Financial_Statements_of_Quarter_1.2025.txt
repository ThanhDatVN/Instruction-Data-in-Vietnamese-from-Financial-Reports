of Vietnam Maritime Corporation - Parent Company. On 20 June 2018, the Prime Minister issued

Company. On 18 June 2020, the State Capital Management Committee at Enterprises issued a

of the initial share offering of Vietnam Maritime Corporation. The Corporation successfully held the /f
first General Meeting of Shareholders on 13 August 2020 and officially changed to operate as a Joint /<57
Stock Company on 18 August 2020. 21

by the Department of Planning and Investment of Hanoi City for the first time on 07 July 2010. From
18 August 2020, the Corporation changed its 7th Certificate of Business to officially switch to

inland waterway and road transportation, and supporting services related to transportation; port and
inland waterway terminal operations; agency services, freight forwarding, logistics, warehousing, and
storage of goods, as well as debt trading.
1.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF CORPORATION ACTIVITIES DURING THE
ACCOUNTING PERIOD THAT ADDECT THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
In the first quarter of 2025, Vietnam’s economy maintained its growth, providing a significant
boost to import-export activities - a major favorable factor for maritime transport operations. However,
the global economic recovery remained slow and uncertain, directly impacting cargo transportation
demand and potentially leading to reduced shipping volumes. Geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea
region continued to disrupt trade routes, increasing operating costs and causing substantial,
unpredictable volatility in international freight rates. Rising competitive pressure from new shipping
fleets in the global market has intensified, exerting downward pressure on both revenue and profit
margins in the maritime transport segment. As a result, Vietnam Maritime Corporation and its
subsidiaries, being collectively impacted by the developments in the international shipping market,
recorded a consolidated pre-tax profit of only VND 454 billion in Quarter 1/2025, compared to VND
576 billion in the same period last year.
