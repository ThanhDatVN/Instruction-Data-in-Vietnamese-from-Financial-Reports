Subsidiary
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control over their financial policies and operational
activities. The financial statements of these Subsidiaries have been prepared for the same financial period as
the Parent Company, applying accounting policies consistent with the Parent Company's accounting policies.
Adjusting entries have been made for any accounting policies with differences to ensure consistency between
the Subsidiaries and the Parent Company.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealized profits from intercompany transactions,

when the cost is not recoverable. Ihe interest of non-controlling shareholders represents the portion of
profits or losses and net assets not held by the Group's shareholders and is presented separately in the
consolidated income statement and the consolidated balance sheet.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the Parent Company obtains control and will cease to be

Parent Company no longer has control over the Subsidiaries, the consolidated financial statements will
include the results of operations for the period during which the Parent Company still had control.
The financial statements of Subsidiaries subject to joint control business consolidation are included in the
Parent Company’s consolidated financial statements using the equity method. The financial statements of
other Subsidiaries are consolidated into the Parent Company’s financial statements using the acquisition

consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of income
and expenses of the associates, accounted for under the equity method, after adjustments in line with the
Group's accounting policies, from the date significant influence begins until the date such influence ends.
When the Group’s share of losses in an associate exceeds the Group’s interest in the associate, as accounted
for under the equity method, the carrying amount of the investment (including long-term investments, if any)
is written down to zero, and no further losses are recognized, unless the Group has an obligation to pay or
has already paid on behalf of the associate ^

Provision for the devaluation of trading securities is made for each type of security that is traded on the
market and has a market price lower than its cost. The fair value of listed trading securities on the stock
exchange or traded on UPCOM is the closing price on the financial reporting date. If no transaction occurs
on the stock market or UPCOM on the reporting date, the fair value is based on the closing price of the
nearest trading session prior to the reporting date.
Any increase or decrease in the provision for devaluation of trading securities as of the financial reporting
date shall be recorded as financial expenses
Loans
Receivables from loans are presented in the financial statements at their original cost, less an allowance for

dividends are only tracked in terms of the increase in the number of shares and are not recognized as the
value of the shares received.
Impairment of investments in equity instruments of other entities is made as follows:
For investments in listed shares or where the fair value of the investment can be reliably determined,
the impairment is based on the market value of the shares.
For investments where the fair value cannot be reliably determined at the reporting date, the
impairment is based on the loss of the invested entity. The impairment is calculated as the difference
between the actual contributions made by the parties to the other entity and the actual equity,
multiplied by the Company’s ownership percentage in the other entity relative to the total capital
contributed by all parties.

The value of inventory is calculated using the weighted average cost method and is accounted for using the
perpetual inventory method.
An allowance for inventory impairment is made for each item of inventory where the cost exceeds the net
realizable value. For services in progress, the impairment allowance is calculated for each type of service
based on its specific price. Any increase or decrease in the allowance for inventory impairment that needs to

removed from the books, and the gain or loss from disposal is recognized in the income or expenses of the
year.

estimated useful life. The number of years of depreciation for types of tangible fixed assets is as follows:

15. Financial expenses
Financial expenses are costs related to financial activities, including expenses or losses associated with
financial investments, lending and borrowing activities, and capital contributions to joint ventures or
associates.
Borrowing costs include interest on loans and other expenses directly related to borrowings. If borrowing
costs are directly associated with the investment, construction, or production of qualifying assets under
development that require a significant period (over 12 months) to become operational or ready for sale, such
costs are capitalized. For loans specifically taken for the construction of fixed assets or investment
properties, interest is capitalized even if the construction period is less than 12 months. Income earned from
the temporary investment of such loans is deducted from the original cost of the related asset.
For general borrowings used partially for the purpose of constructing or producing qualifying assets under
development, the capitalized borrowing costs are determined based on a capitalization rate applied to the
weighted average cumulative costs incurred for the construction or production of those assets. The
capitalization rate is calculated based on the weighted average interest rate of all outstanding borrowings
during the period, excluding loans that are specifically allocated for the purpose of creating a particular asset.
16. Selling expenses and Administrative expenses
Selling expenses and Administrative expenses are all costs incurred in the process of selling products, goods,
providing services, and the general management expenses of the Group.
