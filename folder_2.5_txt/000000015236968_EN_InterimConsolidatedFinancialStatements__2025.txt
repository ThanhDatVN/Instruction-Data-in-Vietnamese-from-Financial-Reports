REVIEW REPORT ON INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
To: Shareholders, The Board of Directors and The Board of Management
Tan Bien Rubber Joint Stock Company
We have reviewed the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of Tan Bien Rubber Joint Stock Company
prepared on 25 July 2025 from page 05 to page 43, including: Interim Consolidated Statement of Financial
position as at 30 June 2025, Interim Consolidated Statement of Income, Interim Consolidated Statement of Cash
flows, and Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial statements for the six-month period then ended.
Board of Management’s Responsibility
The Board of Management is responsible for the preparation of Interim Consolidated Financial Statements that
give a true and fair view in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting
System and the statutory requirements relevant to preparation and presentation of Interim Consolidated Financial
Statements and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
ip
Interim Consohdated Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
M
Auditor’s Responsibility ĩOÌ
c
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these Interim Consolidated Financial Statements based on our
review'. We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity.
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially
less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing and consequently does
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Auditor’s Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements does not give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the financial
position of the Tan Bien Rubber Joint Stock Company as at 30 June 2025, and of its financial performance and its
cash flows for the six-month period then ended in accordance with the Vietnamese Accounting Standards,
Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting System and the statutory requirements relevant to preparation and presentation
of Interim Consolidated financial statements.
