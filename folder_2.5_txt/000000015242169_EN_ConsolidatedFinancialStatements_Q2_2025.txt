CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the fiscal period ended 30th June 2025
The financial performance of subsidiaries, which is bought or sold during the year, are included in the
Consolidated Income Statement from the date of acquisition or until the date of selling investments in
those subsidiaries.
The Financial Statements of the Parent Company and those of subsidiaries used for consolidation are
prepared in the same fiscal year and apply consistently accounting policies to the same types of
transactions and events in similar circumstances. In the case that the accounting policy of a subsidiary
is different from the accounting policy applied consistently in the Group, the Financial Statements of
that subsidiary will be properly adjusted before being used for the preparation of the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Intra-group balances in the Balance Sheet and intra-group transactions and unrealized profits resulting
from these transactions must be completely eliminated. Unrealized losses resulting from intra-group
transactions are also eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
Benefits of non-controlling shareholders reflect profit or loss and net assets of subsidiary, which are
not hold by the Group and presented in a separate item of the Consolidated Income Statement and
Consolidated Balance Sheet (classified under “Owner’s equity”). Benefits of non-controlling
shareholders include the values of their non-controlling benefits at the initial date of business
combination and those arise within the ranges of changes in owner’s equity from the date of business
combination. The losses arising in the subsidiaries are attributed equally to the ownership rate of non­
controlling shareholders, even if such losses are higher than the interest owned by these shareholders
in net assets of the subsidiaries.
In case where subsidiaries raise capital from the owners, if the additional capital contribution rate of
the involved parties is not in correspondence with the current capital ownership rate, the difference
between the additional capital contribution rate of the Group and the increase of the ownership share
in the subsidiaries’ net assets is recorded into item “Retained earnings” on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.
3. Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the actual exchange rates ruling as of the
transaction dates. The ending balances of monetary items in foreign currencies are converted at the
actual exchange rates ruling as of the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arisen from foreign currency transactions during the year shall be
included into financial income or financial expenses. Foreign exchange differences due to the
revaluation of ending balances of the monetary items in foreign currencies after offsetting their
positive differences against negative differences shall be included into financial income or financial
expenses.
The exchange rate used to convert foreign currency transactions is the actual exchange rate ruling as at
the time of these transactions. The actual exchange rates applied to foreign currency transactions are as
follows:
• For the foreign currency trading contract (including spot contract, forward contract, future
contract, option contract, currency swap): the exchange rate stipulated in the contracts of trading
foreign currency between the Company and the Bank.
• For capital contribution received: the buying rate of the bank where the Company opens its
account to receive capital contributed from investors as of the date of capital contribution.
• For receivables: the buying rate ruling as at the time of transaction of the commercial bank where
the Company designates the customers to make payments.

For the fiscal period ended 30th June 2025
• For payables: the selling rate ruling as at the time of transaction of the commercial bank where the
Company supposes to make payments.
• For acquisition of assets or immediate payments in foreign currency (not included into payable
accounts): the buying rate of the commercial bank where the Company makes payments.
The exchange rates used to re-evaluate the ending balances of monetary items in foreign currencies are
determined according to the following principles:
• For foreign currency deposits: the buying rate of the bank where the Company opens its foreign
currency account.
• For monetary items in foreign currencies classified as other assets: the buying rate of the bank
where the Company frequently conducts transactions.
• For monetary items in foreign currencies classified as liabilities: the selling rate of the bank where
the Company frequently conducts transactions.
4. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits in banks. Cash equivalents are short-term
investments of which the due dates cannot exceed 3 months from the dates of the investments and the
convertibility into cash is easy, and which do not have a lot of risks in the conversion into cash as of
the balance sheet date.
5. Financial investments
Investment in associates
The Group’s investment in associates is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. An
associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary
nor a joint venture. The Group generally deems they have significant influence if they have over 20%
of the voting rights.
Under the equity method, the investment is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associates. Goodwill arising on
acquisition of the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill is not
amortised and subject to annual review for impairment. The consolidated income statement reflects the
share of the post-acquisition results of operation of the associate.
The share of post-acquisition profit (loss) of the associates is presented on face of the consolidated s
income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. 5
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the
investment. Dividend/profit sharing receivable from associates reduces the carrying amount of the
investment.
The financial statements of the associates are prepared for the same reporting year and use the same
accounting policies as the Group. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting
policies in line with those of the Group.
Held-to-maturity in vestments
Investments are classified as held-to-maturity investments that the Company intends and is able to
hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments include term deposits.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at cost including the purchase cost and other
transaction costs. After initial recognition, these investments are recorded at recoverable value.
Interest from these held-to-maturity investments after acquisition date is recognized in the profit or
loss on the basis of the interest income to be received. Interests arising prior to the Company’s
acquisition of held-to-maturity investments are recorded as a decrease in the costs as at the acquisition
time.

the loss are reliably determined, the loss is recognized as financial expenses during the year while the
investment value is derecognized.
Provision for diminution in value of investments
Provision of the investment is made when there is reliable evidence of the diminution in value of those
investments at the balance sheet date. Increases or decreases to the provision balance are recorded as
finance expense in the consolidated income statement.
6. Receivables
Receivables are recognized at the carrying amounts less allowances for doubtful debts.
The classification of receivables as trade receivables and other receivables is made according the
following principles:
• Trade receivables reflect receivables concerning the commercial nature arising from purchase and
sale transactions between the Company and customers who are independent to the Company.
• Other receivables reflect receivables not concerning the commercial nature and irrelevant to
purchase and sale transactions.
Allowance is made for each doubtful debt on the basis of the ages of debts after offsetting against
liabilities (if any) or estimated loss as follows:
• As for overdue debts:
30% of the value of debts overdue between more than 6 months and less than 1 year.
50% of the value of debts overdue between 1 year and less than 2 years.
70% of the value of debts overdue between 2 years and less than 3 years.
100% of the value of debts overdue more than 3 years. /
• As for doubtful debts: Allowance is made on the basis of the estimated loss.
Increases/(decreases) in the obligatory allowance for doubtful debts as of the balance sheet date are
recorded into “General and administration expenses”. A
7. Prepaid expenses
Prepaid expenses comprise actual expenses arising and relevant to financial performance in several
accounting periods.
8. Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are determined by their historical costs less accumulated depreciation. Historical
costs of tangible fixed assets include all the expenses paid by the Company to bring the asset to its
working condition for its intended use. Other expenses arising subsequent to initial recognition are
included into historical costs of fixed assets only if it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure
has resulted in future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of these assets. Those
which do not meet the above conditions will be recorded into operation costs during the year.
When a tangible fixed asset is sold or disposed, its historical cost and accumulated depreciation are
written off, then any gain or loss arising from such disposal is included in the income or the expenses
during the year.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated in accordance with the straight-line method over their estimated
useful lives. The depreciation years applied are as follows:

Intangible fixed assets are determined by their initial costs less accumulated amortization.
Initial costs of intangible fixed assets include all the costs paid by the Company to bring the asset to its
working condition for its intended use. Other costs relevant to intangible fixed assets arising
subsequent to initial recognition are included into operation costs during the year only if these costs
are associated with a specific intangible fixed asset and result in future economic benefits expected to
be obtained from the use of these assets.
When an intangible fixed asset is sold or disposed, its initial costs and accumulated amortization are
written off, then any gain or loss arising from such disposal is included in the income or the expenses
during the year.
The Company’s intangible fixed asset includes computer software. Purchase price of computer
software, which is not a part associated with the relevant hardware, will be capitalized. Initial costs of
computer software include all the expenses paid by the Company until the date the software is put into
use. Computer software is amortized in accordance with the straight-line method from 3-10 years.
10. Payables and accrued expenses
Payables and accrued expenses are recorded for the amounts payable in the future associated with the
goods and services received. Accrued expenses are recorded based on reasonable estimates for the
amounts payable.
The classification of payables as trade payables, accrued expenses, and other payables is made on the
basis of following principles:
• Trade payables reflect payables of commercial nature arising from the purchase of goods, services,
or assets, of which the seller is an independent entity with the Company.
• Accrued expenses reflect expenses for goods, services received from suppliers or supplied to
customers but have not been paid, invoiced or lack of accounting records and supporting
documents; pay on leave payable to employees; and accrual of operation expenses.
• Other payables reflect payables of non-commercial nature and irrelevant to purchase, sales of
goods or provisions of services.
The payables and accrued expenses are classified as short-term and long-term items in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet on the basis of their remaining term as of the balance sheet date.
11. Capital
Capital is recorded according to the actual amounts invested by the members.
12. Profit distribution
Profit after tax is distributed to the members after appropriation for funds under the Charter of the

13. Recognition of sales and income
Sales of service provision
Sales of service provision shall be recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
• The amount of sales can be measured reliably. When the contract stipulates that the buyer is
entitled to return the services provided under specific conditions, sales is recognized only when
these specific conditions are no longer existed and the buyer is not entitled to return the services
provided.
• The Company received or shall probably receive the economic benefits associated with the
provision of services.
• The stage of completion of the transaction at the end of reporting period can be measured reliably.
• The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured

In the case that the services are provided in several accounting periods, the determination of sales is
done on the basis of the volume of work done as of the balance sheet date.
Interest
Interest is recorded, based on the term and the actual interest rate applied in each particular period.
14. Revenue deductions
Revenue deductions only include service discounts arising in the same period of service provision,
which are adjusted to reduce revenue in the arising period. ™
In case the service has been provided in previous years, but service discounts only arise this year,
revenue is recorded as a reduction according to the following principles:
• If the service discount arises before the issuance of the Financial Statement: record a reduction in
revenue on the Financial Statement of this year. a]
• If the service discount arises after the issuance of the Financial Statement: record a reduction in
revenue on the Financial Statement of the following year.
15. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are interests and other costs that the Company directly incurs in connection with the
borrowing.
Borrowing costs are recorded as an expense when it is incurred. In case the borrowing costs are
directly attributable to the construction or the production of an asset in progress, which takes a
substantial period of time (over 12 months) to get ready for intended use or sales of the asset, these
costs will be included in the cost of that asset. To the extent that the borrowings are especially for the
purpose of construction of fixed assets and investment properties, the borrowing cost is eligible for
capitalization even if construction period is under 12 months. Incomes arisen from provisional
investments as loans are recognized as a decrease in the costs of relevant assets.
In the event that general borrowings are partly used for the acquisition, construction or production of
an asset in progress, the costs eligible for capitalization will be determined by applying the
capitalization rate to average accumulated expenditure on construction or production of that asset. The
capitalization rate is computed at the weighted average interest rate of the borrowings not yet paid
during the period, except for particular borrowings serving the purpose of obtaining a specific asset.

16. Expenses
Expenses are those that result in outflows of the economic benefits and are recorded at the time of
transactions or when incurrence of the transaction is reliable regardless of whether payment for
expenses is made or not.
Expenses and their corresponding revenues are simultaneously recognized in accordance with
matching principle. In the event that matching principle conflicts with prudence principle, expenses
are recognized based on the nature and regulations of accounting standards in order to guarantee that
transactions can be fairly and truly reflected.
17. Corporate income tax
Corporate income tax includes current income tax and deferred income tax.
Current income tax
Current income tax is the tax amount computed based on the taxable income. Taxable income is
different from accounting profit due to the adjustments of temporary differences between tax and
accounting figures, non-deductible expenses as well as those of non-taxable income and losses brought
forward.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is the amount of corporate income tax payable or refundable due to temporary
differences between book values of assets and liabilities serving the preparation of the Consolidated
Financial Statements and the values for tax purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized
for all the temporary taxable differences. Deferred income tax assets are recorded only when there is
an assurance on the availability of taxable income in the future against which the temporarily
deductible differences can be used.
Carrying values of deferred corporate income tax assets are considered as of the balance sheet date and
will be reduced to the rate that ensures enough taxable income against which the benefits from part of
or all of the deferred income tax can be used. Deferred corporate income tax assets, which have not
been recorded before, are considered as of the balance sheet date and are recorded when there is
certainly enough taxable income to use these unrecognized deferred corporate income tax assets.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are determined at the estimated rate to
be applied in the year when the assets are recovered or the liabilities are settled based on the effective
tax rates as of the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is recognized in the Income Statement. In
the case that deferred income tax is related to the items of the owner’s equity, corporate income tax
will be included in the owner’s equity.
The Company shall offset deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if:
• The Company has the legal right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax
liabilities; and
• Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are relevant to corporate income tax
which is under the management of one tax authority either:
Of the same subject to corporate income tax; or
The Company has intention to pay current income tax liabilities and current income tax assets
on a net basis or recover tax assets and settle tax liability simultaneously in each future period
to the extent that the majority of deferred income tax liabilities or deferred income tax assets
are paid or recovered.
18. Related parties

or to cause material effects on the financial decisions as well as the operations of the Company. A
