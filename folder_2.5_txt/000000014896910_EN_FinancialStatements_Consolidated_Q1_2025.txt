2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
2.1 Basis of preparation of consolidated interim financial statements
The consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Corporate Accounting System and
applicable regulations on preparation and presentation of consolidated interim financial
statements. The consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention except for investments in associates, and business
combinations.
The accompanying consolidated interim financial statements are not intended to present
the financial position and results of its operations and its cash flows in accordance with
accounting principles and practices generally accepted in countries and jurisdictions other
than Vietnam. The accounting principles and practices utilised in Vietnam may differ from
those generally accepted in countries and jurisdictions other than Vietnam.
The consolidated interim financial statements in Vietnamese language are the official
statutory consolidated interim financial statements of the Group. The consolidated interim
financial statements in English language have been translated from the Vietnamese
version.
2.2 Fiscal year
The Group’s fiscal year is from 1 January to 31 December.
2.3 Currency
The consolidated interim financial statements are measured and presented in
Vietnamese Dong (“VND” or “Dong”), which is the Group’s accounting currency.
2.4 Exchange rates
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates prevailing at
the transaction dates. Foreign exchange differences arising from these transactions are
regconised in the consolidated interim income statement.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the consolidated
interim balance sheet date are respectively translated at the buying and selling exchange
rates at the consolidated interim balance sheet date of the commercial bank(s) with which
the Group regularly transacts. Foreign currencies deposited in banks at the consolidated
interim balance sheet date are translated at the buying exchange rate of the commercial
bank where the Group opens its foreign currency accounts. Foreign exchange differences
arising from these translations are regconised in the consolidated interim income
statement.

2.5 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial
and operating policies in order to gain future benefits from their activities generally
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. The existence
and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are
considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are
fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de­
consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries
by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given,
equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange,
plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at
their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling
interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of
the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is
less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is
recognised directly in the consolidated interim income statement.
In a multi-phase acquisition, when determining goodwill or bargain purchase, the
consideration is the sum of the total consideration on the date of acquiring control and
previous considerations remeasured to fair value on the date of control acquisition.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions
between group companies are eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The interim financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same accounting
period of the Group for the consolidation purpose. If there are differences in end dates,
the gap must not exceed 3 months. Adjustments are made to reflect impacts of significant
transactions and events occurring between the end dates of the subsidiaries’ accounting
period and that of the Group’s. The length of the reporting period and differences in
reporting date must be consistent between periods.

Form B 09a - DN/HN
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.5 Basis of consolidation (continued)
Non-controlling transactions and interests
The Group applies a policy for transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions
with external parties to the Group.
Non-controlling interests (“NCI”) are measured at their proportionate share of the
acquiree’s identifiable net assets at date of acquisition.
A divestment of the Group's interest in a subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control
is accounted for as a transaction with owners. The difference between the change in the
Group’s share of net assets of the subsidiary and any consideration paid or received from
divestment of the Group’s interest in the subsidiary is recorded directly in the
undistributed earnings under equity.
In a divestment of the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that results in a loss of control, the
difference between the Group’s share in the net assets of the subsidiary and the net
proceeds from divestment is recognised in the consolidated interim income statement.
The retained interest in the entity will be accounted for as either an investment in another
entity or investment to be accounted for as equity for since the divestment date.
Associates
Associates are investments that the Group has significant influence but not control over
and the Group would generally have from 20% to less han 50% of the voting rights of the
investee. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The Group's investment in associates
includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss.
The Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of its joint ventures and those
of its associates is recognised in the consolidated interim income statement. The
cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the
investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its
interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associates in accordance with the
current accounting policies.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
2.6 Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the
Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary or associate at the
date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is recognised as an asset and
is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated period of benefit but not exceeding
a period of 10 years.
Goodwill on acquisitions of investments in associates is included in the carrying amount
of the investments at the date of acquisition. The Group does not amortise this goodwill.
On disposal of the investments in subsidiaries or associates, the attributable amount of
unamortised goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on the disposal.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation, and is tested annually for
impairment. If there is evidence that the impairment during the year is higher than the
annual goodwill charge, the Group records the impairment immediately in the accounting
period.
2.7 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, cash at banks, and other short-term
investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
2.8 Receivables
Receivables represent trade receivables from customers arising from sales of goods and
rendering of services or non-trade receivables from others and are stated at cost.
Provision for doubtful debts is made for each outstanding amount based on overdue days
in payment according to the initial payment commitment (exclusive of the payment
rescheduling between parties) or based on the estimated loss that may arise. The
difference between the provision of this period and the provision of the previous period is
recognised as an increase or decrease of general and administration expenses in the
period. Bad debts are written off when identified as uncollectible.
Receivables are classified into short-term and long-term receivables on the consolidated
interim balance sheet based on the remaining period from the consolidated interim
balance sheet date to the maturity date.

2.9 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by
the weighted average method and includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and
other directly-related costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location
and condition. In the case of manufactured products, cost includes all direct expenditure
and production overheads based on normal levels of operating activity. Net realisable
value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less the estimated
costs of completion and selling expenses.
Construction materials and construction work are stated at the lower of cost and net
realizable value. Cost is determined by the weighted average method and includes all
costs of purchasing and other costs of acquiring construction materials and of
constructing the work in its present location and condition. Net realizable value is the
estimated selling price of building materials and construction works in the ordinary course
of business, less the estimated costs of completion and transfer expenses.
The Group applies the perpetual system for inventories.
Provision is made, where necessary, for obsolete, slow-moving, and defective inventory
items. The difference between the provision of this period and the provision of the
previous period is recognised as an increase or decrease of cost of goods sold in the
period.
2.10 Investments
(a) Investments held to maturity
Investments held to maturity are investments which the Group has a positive intention
and ability to hold until maturity.
Investments held to maturity include term deposits and bonds held to maturity. Those
investments are initially accounted for at cost. Subsequently, the Board of Management
reviews all outstanding investments to determine the amount of provision to recognise at
the period end.
Provision for diminution in value of investments held to maturity is made when there is
evidence that the investment is uncollectible in whole or in part. Changes in the provision
balance during the accounting period are recorded as an increase or decrease in financial
expenses. A reversal, if any, is made only to the extent the investment is restored to its
original cost.
Investments held to maturity are classified into short-term and long-term investments held
to maturity on the consolidated interim balance sheet based on the remaining period from
the consolidated interim balance sheet date to the maturity date.

(b) Investments in associates
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method when preparing the
consolidated interim financial statements (Note 2.5).
(c) Investments in other entities
Investments in other entities are investments in equity instruments of other entities without
controlling rights or co-controlling rights, or without significant influence over the investee.
These investments are accounted for initially at cost. Subsequently, the Board of
Management reviews all outstanding investments to determine the amount of provision
to recognise at the period end.
Provision for investments in other entities is made when there is a diminution in value of
the investments at the period end. Provision for investments in other entities is calculated
based on market value if market value can be determined reliably. If market value can
not be determined reliably, the provision is calculated based on the loss of investees.
Changes in the provision balance during the accounting period are recorded as an
increase or decrease in financial expenses. A reversal, if any, is made only to the extent
the investment is restored to its original cost.
2.11 Lendings <
Lendings are lendings granted for the earning interest under agreements among parties
but not for being traded as securities.
Lendings are initially recognised at cost. Subsequently, the Board of Management
reviews all outstanding amounts to determine the amount of provision to recognise at the
period end. Provision for doubtful lending is made for each lending based on overdue
days in payment of principals according to the initial payment commitment (exclusive of
the payment rescheduling between parties) or based on the expected loss that may arise.
Changes in the provision balance during the accounting period are recorded as an
increase or decrease in financial expenses. A reversal, if any, is made only to the extent
the investment is restored to its original cost.
Lendings are classified into short-term and long-term lendings on the consolidated interim
balance sheet based on the remaining term of the lendings as at the consolidated interim
balance sheet date.

2.12 Construction contracts
A construction contract is a contract specifically negotiated for the construction of an
asset or a combination of assets that are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms
of design, technology and functions or ultimate purpose of use.
When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, and the contractor
is paid, contract revenue and contract costs are recognised over the period of the contract
as revenue and expenses, respectively for the works performed and certified by
customer. The compensation and other revenue are only recognised in revenue when
certified by customer.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be reliably estimated, contract
revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable those
costs will be recoverable. Contract costs are only recognised when incurred during the
period.
2.13 Business cooperation contract
A business cooperation contract ("BCC”) is a contract between the Group and other
parties to carry out specific business activities without establishing a new legal entity.
These activities are controlled by one of the parties. The BCC is based on shares of post­
tax profits. The parties in a BCC may agree to share profits after tax.
A BCC in the form of shares of profits after tax is jointly controlled or controlled by one
party.
• If a BCC states that each party is entitled to a fixed amount of profit regardless of the
performance of the BCC, it is a lease of asset in substance.
• If the BCC states that each party is entitled to profits when the BCC is profitable and
is required to bear losses when the BCC is loss making, in subtance, the BCC parties
share revenue and expenses because each party can jointly control the operation
and cash flows of the BCC.
When the Group is not in charge of accounting and tax finalisation, the Group accounts
for its proportionate share of revenue and expenses from the BCC.

2.14 Fixed assets
Tangible and intangible fixed assets
Fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortisation.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the
fixed assets bringing them to suitable conditions fortheir intended use. Expenditure which
is incurred subsequently and has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits
expected to be obtained from the use of fixed assets, can be capitalised as an additional
historical cost. Otherwise, such expenditure is charged to the consolidated interim income
statement when incurred.
Depreciation and amortisation
Fixed assets are depreciated and amortised using the straight-line method so as to write
off the cost of the depreciable amount of the fixed assets over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciable amount equals to the historical cost of fixed assets recorded in the financial
statements minus (-) the estimated disposal value of such assets. The estimated useful
lives of each asset class are as follows:
Buildings and structures 3-30 years
Machinery and equipment 3-15 years
Motor vehicles 6-10 years
Office equipment 3 - 10 years
Software 3 years
Others 5 years
Land use rights 50 years
Land use rights comprise of land use rights and prepaid land use rights obtained under
land rental contracts which are effective before the effective date of land law 2003 (ie. 1
July 2004) and which land use right certificates are granted, including:
Definite land use rights are stated at costs less accumulated amortisation. Costs of land
use rights consists of its purchased prices and any directly attributable costs in obtaining
the land use rights. Land use rights are amortised using the straight-line basis over the
terms of the land use right certificates. '
H
Indefinite land use rights are stated at costs and not amortised.
Other tangible fixed assets, which is the Dong Nai Bridge project, is depreciated according
to the provisions of Circular No. 147/2016/TT-BTC dated 13 October 2016. Depreciation
of fixed assets is determined as the exploitation period to return the investor's investment
in the project. The depreciation of fixed assets is proportional to the annual revenue in
accordance with the exploitation period to collect to return the investor's investment in the
project (similar to the method of depreciation according to the quantity and volume of
products).
Disposal
Gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing net disposal proceeds with
the carrying amount of the fixed assets and are recognised as income or expense in the
consolidated interim income statement.

2.14 Fixed assets (continued)
Construction in progress
Construction in progress represents the cost of assets in the course of installation or
construction for production, rental or administrative purposes, or for purposes not yet
determined, which are recorded at cost and are comprised of such necessary costs to
construct, repair and maintain, upgrade, renew or equip the projects with technologies as
construction costs; costs of tools and equipments; compensation and resettlement costs;
project management expenditure; construction consulting expenditure; and capitalised
borrowing costs for qualifying assets in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other fixed assets, commences when
the assets are ready fortheir intended use.
2.15 Operating lease
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the lessor has transferred the ownership
at the end of the lease period, and transferred substantially the risks and rewards, are
classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease
at the lower of the fair value of leased assets or the present value of the minimum lease
payments.
Each lease payment is separate between the liability and finance charges to achieve a
constant rate on the outstanding finance lease balance. The corresponding rental
obligations, net of finance charge, are included in long-term borrowings.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease
term. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leasing contracts is
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the
assets or the lease term. However, if there is reasonable certainty that the lessee will
obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, depreciation is calculated over the
estimated useful life of the assets.
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by
the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are
charged to the consolidated interim income statement on a straight-line basis over the
term of the lease.
2.16 Investment properties held for lease
The historical cost of an investment property held for lease represents the amount of cash
or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of another consideration given to acquire the
investment property held for lease at the time of its acquisition or completion of
construction. Expenditure incurred subsequently which has resulted in an increase in the
expected future economic benefits from the use of investment properties held for lease
can be capitalised as an additional historical cost. Otherwise, such expenditure is charged
to the consolidated interim income statement when incurred in the period.

2.16 Investment properties held for lease (continued)
Depreciation
Investment properties held for lease are depreciated on straight-line basis to write off the
depreciable amount of the assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciable amount
equals to the historical cost of assets recorded in the financial statements minus (-) the
estimated disposal value of such assets. The estimated useful lives of each asset class
are as follows:
Land use rights 50 years
Buildings and structures 25 years
Disposals
Gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing net disposal proceeds with
the carrying amount of investment properties and are recognised as income or expense
in the consolidated interim income statement.
2.17 Prepaid expenses
Prepaid expenses include short-term and long-term prepayments on the consolidated
interim balance sheet. Short-term prepaid expenses reflect prepayments for services; or
tools that do not meet the recognition criteria for fixed assets for a period not exceeding
12 months or a business cycle from the date of prepayments. Long-term prepaid
expenses reflect prepayments for services; or tools that do not meet the recognition
criteria for fixed assets for a period exceeding 12 months or more than one business cycle
from the date of prepayments. Prepaid expenses are recorded at historical cost and
allocated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
2.18 Payables
Classifications of payables are based on their nature as follows:
• Trade accounts payable are trade payables arising from purchase of goods and
services: and
• Other payables including non-trade payables, and not relating to purchase of goods
and services.
Payables are classified into short-term and long-term payables on the consolidated
interim balance sheet based on remaining period from the consolidated interim balance
sheet date to the maturity date.

2.19 Borrowings and finance lease liabilities
Borrowings and finance lease liabilities include borrowings and finance lease liabilities
from banks, and other entities.
Borrowings and finance lease liabilities are classified into short-term and long-term on the
consolidated interim balance sheet based on their remaining period term from the
consolidated interim balance sheet date to the maturity date.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of any
qualifying assets are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and
prepare the asset for its intended use. In respect of general-purpose borrowings a portion
of which used for the purpose of construction or production of any qualifying assets, the
Group determines the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation by applying a
capitalisation rate to the weighted average expenditure on the assets. The capitalisation
rate is the weighted average of the interest rates applicable to the Group’s borrowings
that are outstanding during the year, other than borrowings made specificially for the
purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. Other borrowing costs are recognised in the
consolidated interim income statement when incurred.
2.20 Accrued expenses
Accrued expenses include liabilities for goods and services received in the year but not
yet paid for, due to pending invoices or insufficient records and documents; other
payables to employees; accrued interest expense and project costs in the accounting
period. Accrued expenses are recorded as expenses in the reporting period.
2.21 Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation
as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to
settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provision is not
recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the level of the expenditures expected to be required to settle
the obligation. If the time value of money is material, provision will be measured at the
present value using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due
to passage of time is regconise as a financial expense. Changes in the provision balance
during the accounting period are recorded as an increase or decrease in operating
expenses.

2.22 Unearned revenue
Unearned revenue mainly comprises the amounts that customers have paid in advance
for one or many accounting periods for asset leases. The Group records unearned
revenue for the future obligations that the Group has to fulfil. Unearned revenue is
recognised as revenue in the consolidated interim income statement during the year to
the extent that revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Unearned revenue is classified short-term and long-term on the consolidated interim
balance sheet based on the obligations that the Group will perform within next 12 months
or normal business cycle and after next 12 months or after normal business cycle as at
consolidated interim balance sheet date.
2.23 Capital and reserves
Owners’ capital is recorded according to the actual amounts contributed and is recorded
according to the par value of the shares.
Share premium is the difference between the par value and the issue price of shares; the
difference between the repurchase price and re-issuing price of treasury shares.
Treasury shares bought before the effective date of the Securities Law (ie. 1 January
2021) are shares issued by the Company and bought back by itself, but these are not
cancelled and may be re-issued subsequently in accordance with the Law on Securities.
Treasury shares bought after 1 January 2021 will be cancelled and adjusted to reduce
equity.

associated with their purchases, the Group allocates the total considerations received
between goods sold and promotional goods. The cost of promotional goods is recognised
as cost of sales in the consolidated interim income statement.
(b) Revenue from construction contract
Revenues from construction contracts are comprised of the revenue initially set out in
contracts; increases and/or decreases during the term of the contract; bonuses; and
other payments to be received from customers or other parties to compensate for the
costs not included in the contractual price; other payments that customers agreed to
compensate; and other payments provided that these amounts can change the revenue
and can be reliably determined.

2.27 Cost of goods sold and services rendered
Cost of goods sold and services rendered are the cost of finished goods, merchandise,
materials sold or services rendered during the period, and recorded on the basis of
matching with revenue and on a prudent basis.
2.28 Financial expenses
Financial expenses are expenses incurred in the period for financial activities including
expenses or losses relating to financial investment activity, expenses of borrowing;
provision for diminution in value of investments; losses incurred when selling foreign
currencies; losses from foreign exchange differences; and payment discounts.
2.29 Selling expenses
Selling expenses represent expenses that are incurred in the process of selling products,
goods, and providing services.
2.30 General and administration expenses
General and administration expenses represent expenses that are incurred for
administrative purposes of the Group.
2.31 Current and deferred income tax
Income tax includes all income tax which is based on taxable profits. Income tax expense
comprises current income tax expense and deferred income tax expense.
Current income tax is the amount of income tax payable or recoverable in respect of the
current period taxable profits at the current period tax rates. Current and deferred income
tax are recognised as an income or an expense and included in the profit or loss of the
period, except to the extent that the income tax arises from a transaction or event which
is recognised, in the same or a different period, directly in equity.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the
consolidated interim financial statements. Deferred income tax is not accounted for if it
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
combination that at the time of occurrence affects neither the accounting nor the taxable
profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined at the tax rates that are expected to
apply to the accounting period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based
on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the consolidated interim
balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

amounts of revenues and expenses during the accounting period.
Such estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated. They are based on historical
experiences and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have a
