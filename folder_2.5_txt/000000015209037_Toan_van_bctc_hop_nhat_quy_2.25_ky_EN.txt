Profit after tax in Quarter 2/2025 was VND 442,270,165, reflecting a positive shift from loss to
profit, an increase of 137% compared to the same period in Quarter 2/2024 due to the following
reasons:

- In Quarter 2/2025, there were significant exchange rate fluctuations between USD/VND and

dịch tại thời điểm phát sinh nghiệp vụ. Tại thời điểm cuối năm, tài sản là tiền và công nợ có gốc ngoại tệ được
chuyển đổi theo tỷ giá mua vào của ngân hàng thương mại nơi công ty mở tài khoản vào ngày kết thúc niên độ kế
toán. Tất cả các khoản chênh lệch tỷ giá thực tế phát sinh trong kỳ và chênh lệch đánh giá lại của các khoản mục
tiền tệ được kết chuyển dần vào báo cáo kết quả hoạt động kinh doanh của năm tài chính.
2. Recognition of Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash:
Cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits. Transactions in foreign currencies are converted to VND at the
actual exchange rate at the transaction date. Foreign exchange differences arising from business or capital
construction activities are recorded as financial income or expense.
Cash Equivalents:
Cash equivalents are short-term investments (not exceeding three months) that are easily convertible to cash and /
carry minimal risk of value fluctuation. ị
3. Accounting for Financial Investments: I
Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates: Ç
X
Investments in subsidiaries, associates, and other equity investments intended for long-term holding take the
following forms:
-Investment in the form of capital contribution to other entities (as capital is raised by the investee).
-Investment in the form of acquiring equity interests in other entities (purchasing ownership interests from
existing owners).
The carrying value of investments in subsidiaries is determined based on fair value.
The carrying value of investments in associates is determined using the equity method.
The recognition date for investments in subsidiaries and associates is the date on which ownership rights are
officially acquired.Investments in subsidiaries and associates are evaluated for impairment at the time of preparing the Financial
Statements. Provisions for impairment are made based on the Financial Statements of the subsidiaries and
associates if they incur losses (except for losses planned and determined in the business plan prior to the
investment). However, none of the Company's subsidiaries or associates have incurred losses or are in the early
investment stage, so the Company does not need to make impairment provisions.
Net profits distributed from subsidiaries and associates arising after the investment date are recognized in the
Statement of Profit or Loss. Other distributed amounts are recorded as a reduction in the original investment cost.
Investments in Other Entities:
Investments in equity instruments of other entities are recorded at cost.
4. Accounting Principles for Receivables:
Trade Receivables: Reflect receivables and the settlement status of amounts owed to the company by customers
for the sale of products, goods, investment properties, fixed assets, financial investments, and services provided.
Internal Receivables: Reflect receivables and the settlement status of amounts owed between the company and
its subsidiaries or among subsidiaries under the company’s control.
Other Receivables: Reflect receivables and the settlement status of amounts not included in trade receivables or
internal receivables.
At the reporting date, receivables (trade, internal, or other) are classified based on their remaining term:
Short-term Receivables: If the collection or payment period does not exceed 12 months (or one business cycle).
Long-term Receivables: If the collection or payment period exceeds 12 months (or one business cycle).
At the financial statement preparation date, receivables denominated in foreign currencies are revalued using the
actual exchange rate of the commercial bank designated by the company for customer payments.
Provision for Doubtful Debts:
Provisions for doubtful debts represent the estimated loss in value of receivables that may not be recoverable by
the company from customers at the time of preparing the Financial Statements.
5. Principles for Inventory Recognition:
Inventory Valuation Principles and Method of Determining Ending Inventory Value:
Inventory is recognized based on historical cost. The cost of inventory includes the purchase cost, processing
costs, and other directly related costs incurred to bring the inventory to its current location and condition.
Costs excluded from the cost of inventory:
- Trade discounts and purchase price reductions for non-conforming goods.
Costs of materials, labor, and other production/business costs incurred above normal levels.
Storage costs, except for those necessary for further production or those incurred during rhe purchase process.
- Selling expenses.
- General administrative expenses.Method for Determining Ending Inventory Value:Ending inventory value = Beginning inventory value +
Value of inventory purchased during the period - Value of inventory sold during the period.
The inventory cost is calculated using the Weighted Average Cost method.
Inventory Accounting Method: The Perpetual Inventory Method is applied for inventory accounting.
6. Principles for Accounting and Depreciation of Fixed Assets (FA):
Recognition of Tangible and Intangible Fixed Assets:
- Fixed assets are initially recorded at cost. During operations, the Company accounts for fixed assets under three
criteria: historical cost, accumulated depreciation, and net book value.
- The historical cost of fixed assets is defined as the total costs incurred to acquire the asset and bring it to a
location and condition ready for use.
Depreciation Method for Fixed Assets:
Fixed assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line depreciation method. The
depreciation period follows the guidelines set in Circular No. 45/2013/TT-BTC, issued on April 25, 2013, by the
Ministry of Finance. Specific depreciation periods are as follows:
Asset Type Depreciation Period
Buildings, structures 5-45 years
Machinery and equipment 3-15 years
Transportation vehicles 6-10 years
Management equipment 3-8 years
7. Principles for Accounting Prepaid Expenses:
Prepaid expenses include tools, equipment, and other prepaid costs, which are gradually allocated to production
and business expenses using the straight-line method.The allocation period does not exceed 3 years.
8. Principles for Accounting Payables
Payables are tracked in detail based on the payment term, the creditor, and the type of currency involved.
Reflect the status of payments owed by the company to suppliers for materials, goods, services, fixed assets, c
Payables to suppliers, contractors, and service providers are recorded in detail for each creditor.
Include obligations between the parent company and its dependent subsidiaries that do not have independent legal £
status and operate under the parent company's accounting system.
Include obligations that are non-commercial and unrelated to transactions involving the purchase, sale, or
provision of goods and services.
Phải trả khác gồm các khoản phải trả không có tính thương mại, không liên quan đến giao dịch mua, bán, cung
cấp hàng hóa dịch vụ.
At the reporting date, payables to suppliers, internal payables, and other payables are classified based on their
remaining payment terms:
-Short-term Payables: Obligations with a payment term of 12 months or less (or within one business cycle).
-Long-term Payables: Obligations with a payment term exceeding 12 months (or one business cycle).At the financial statement preparation date, payables denominated in foreign currency are revalued using the
foreign currency selling exchange rate of the commercial bank with which the company frequently conducts
transactions.
9. Principles for Recognizing Loans and Finance Lease Liabilities
Loans and finance lease liabilities are tracked in detail according to their repayment terms:Liabilities with
repayment periods exceeding 12 months from the financial statement date are classified as long-term loans and
finance lease liabilities.Liabilities due within the next 12 months from the financial statement date are classified
as short-term loans and finance lease liabilities.
Loans and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into the accounting currency using the
actual exchange rate at the time of the transaction.
Principles for Capitalization of Borrowing Costs
Capitalization Scope:Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of
qualifying assets (assets under construction or unfinished production) are included ir the cost of those assets
(capitalized).These costs include loan interest, amortization of discounts or premiums on bond issuance, and
incidental expenses related to loan procedures.
• Suspension of Capitalization:Capitalization of borrowing costs is temporarily suspended during periods of
interruption in the construction or production of the qualifying asset, unless the interruption is necessary.
• Termination of Capitalization Capitalization ceases when the main activities necessary to prepare the
qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are completed.Borrowing costs incurred thereafter are recognized as
production or business expenses in the period in which they occur.
• Reduction of Borrowing Costs:Income generated from the temporary investment of specifically borrowed funds
pending their use for acquiring qualifying assets must be deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for
capitalization.
Limits on Borrowing Cost Capitalization:Borrowing costs capitalized during a period must not exceed the total
borrowing costs incurred during that period.Interest and amortization of discounts or premiums capitalized in each
period must not exceed the actual interest incurred and the amount of discounts or premiums amortized during
that period.Income generated from the temporary investment of specifically borrowed funds pending their use for
acquiring qualifying assets must be deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.
10. Principles for Recognizing Accrued Expenses
Accrued expenses include loan interest, deferred bond interest, construction costs, and other accrued 1
costs.Construction and design consultancy costs already included in the budget but lacking complete
documentation due to projects being located far away or dispersed across different regions are pre-allocated to the
business production costs for the period to ensure the matching principle between revenue and expenses.The n
value of accrued construction costs is determined based on the estimated project value or provisional
documentation verifying the volume of work completed. The value of accrued design consultancy expenses is
based on contracts and the portion of work completed. When these expenses are incurred, if discrepancies arise
compared to the pre-allocated amounts, accounting adjustments are made to increase or decrease the expenses
corresponding to the discrepancies.
11. Principles for Recognizing Equity
The owner’s investment in the company is recorded based on the actual capital contributed by shareholders.
These represent profits from the company's activities after deducting corporate income tax for the current year and
adjustments from retrospective application of changes in accounting policies or corrections of material errors
from prior periods.After the approval of the Board of Directors, after-tax profits are allocated to company funds in accordance with
the company's charter and current legal regulations.Remaining profits are distributed to shareholders based on
their ownership percentage of shares.
Dividends declared for shareholders are recognized as liabilities in the company’s Statement of Financial Position
after the Board of Directors has issued a dividend distribution announcement.
Funds are allocated in accordance with the company’s charter and resolutions of the annual General Meeting of
Shareholders.
12. Principles and Methods for Recognizing Revenue and Other Income
Revenue includes sales revenue and interest income.
Sales revenue is recognized when all the following conditions are met:
. Sales revenue is recognized when all the following conditions are met:
. The majority of the risks and rewards associated with ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer.

. Revenue can be measured reliably.
. Costs associated with the sale can be identified and measured.
Revenue from Financial Activities:

recognized when both of the following conditions are satisfied:
- There is a likelihood of receiving economic benefits from the transaction.
- Revenue can be measured reliably.
Interest income is recognized on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest rate.
Other income includes non-operating income from:Disposal or liquidation of fixed assets. Gains from revaluation
of assets contributed as capital.Penalties, compensation, and other sources of income.
13. Accounting Principles for Cost of Goods Sold and Expenses ~
COGS reflects the cost of goods, finished products sold during the period, allowable wastage, and provisions for U
inventory devaluation.

Expenses:
Principles and Methods for Recognizing Financial Expenses, Selling Expenses, and Administrative Expenses:
- Costs or losses related to financial investment activities;
- Borrowing costs, including interest expenses and other direct expenses related to oans, are recognized as
expenses in the period. Borrowing costs directly related to the construction or production of incomplete assets are
capitalized into the value of those assets. Capitalized costs include:Interest on loans.Amortization of bond
discounts or premiums.Additional costs incurred in loan procedures.
These expenses are recognized based on the actual amounts incurred during the period and are not offset against
financial income.Selling and Administrative Expenses: Selling expenses and administrative expenses are indirect costs incurred
in supporting the distribution of goods, products, and services to the market and in managing the company's
business operations.
All selling and administrative expenses incurred during the period are immediately recognized in the income
statement for that period when these expenses do not provide economic benefits in subsequent periods.
15. Principles and Methods for Recognizing Corporate Income Tax (CIT) Expenses
Current CIT expenses represent the total tax payable for the current period.
These expenses are determined based on taxable income and the applicable corporate income tax rate for the
current period.
Taxable income differs from net profit reported in the income statement because it excludes certain income or
expenses subject to taxation or deductible in other periods (including any carried forward losses, if applicable).
The determination of CIT expenses is based on prevailing tax regulations. However, these regulations are subject
to change, and the final determination of CIT expenses depends on the results of inspections by the competent tax
authorities.

principles:Accrual Basis, Going Concern, Historical Cost, Matching Principle,Consistency, Prudence, Materiality,
