4. KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES
4.1 . Basis for Preparing Consolidated Financial Statements
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Parent Company and the financial
statements of its subsidiaries, which are subject to control by the Parent Company until the date of annual reporting.
Control is established when the Parent Company has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies of a
subsidiary to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
The operating results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income
statement from the date of acquisition or until the date of disposal.
In cases of necessity, the financial statements of subsidiaries are adjusted to align with the Group’s accounting policies.
All transactions and balances among entities within the Group are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated
financial statements.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are presented as a separate item from the equity
»42
of the Parent Company's shareholders. Non-controlling interests include the value of non-controlling shareholders’
interests at the date of initial business combination and their share of changes in total equity since the date of business NG
combination. PI
Losses incurred by a subsidiary are allocated proportionally to the non-controlling shareholders' ownership, even if TÀ
such losses exceed the non-controlling shareholders’ interest in the subsidiary's net assets. J<
Business Combination
The assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. I-P
Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Conversely,
any shortfall of the purchase price below the fair value of the net assets is recognized directly in the income statement
at the acquisition date.
The non-controlling interest at the initial business combination date is determined based on the non-controlling
shareholders' proportionate share of the fair value of the acquired subsidiary's assets, liabilities, and contingent
liabilities.
4.2 . Foreign Currency Transactions
During the year, transactions conducted in currencies other than VND are converted at the exchange rate on the
transaction date. The balances of monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at the end of the financial year are
converted at the exchange rate provided by the bank where the Parent Company and its subsidiaries maintain accounts.
Exchange rate differences arising from foreign currency transactions during the year are recognized in financial
income or financial expenses. Exchange rate differences resulting from the revaluation of monetary items
denominated in foreign currencies at the end of the financial year, after offsetting the increases and decreases, arc
recognized in financial income or financial expenses.
The exchange rate used to convert foreign currency transactions is the actual exchange rate at the time the transaction
occurs. The actual exchange rate for foreign currency transactions is determined as follows:
- For foreign currency purchases and sales (spot contracts, forward contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, and
swaps): the exchange rate stipulated in the foreign exchange purchase and sale agreement between the Company and
the bank.
- If the contract does not specify a payment exchange rate:
For capital contributions or receiving capital contributions: the exchange rate for purchasing foreign currency from
the bank where the Company maintains an account to receive capital from investors on the date of the contribution.
For receivables: the purchase exchange rate from the commercial bank where the Company instructs the customer to
make payment at the time the transaction occurs.
For payables: the selling exchange rate from the commercial bank where the Company expects to make the payment
at the time the transaction occurs.
For transactions involving the purchase of assets or immediate payments in foreign currency (without going through
payables accounts): the purchase exchange rate from the commercial bank where the Company makes the payment.
The exchange rate used to revalue the balances of monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at the end of the
financial year is determined according to the following principles:
• For foreign currency deposits at banks and monetary items classified as other assets: the purchase exchange
rate of the bank where the Parent Company and its subsidiaries maintain their accounts.• For monetary items classified as payables: the selling exchange rate of the bank where the Parent Company
and its subsidiaries maintain their accounts.
4.3 . Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand, demand deposits, and cash in transit. Cash equivalents are short-term investments with a
maturity of three months or less from the acquisition date, which are easily convertible into a known amount of cash
and subject to minimal risk of changes in value.
4.4 . Financial Investments
Held-to-maturity Investments
An investment is classified as held-to-maturity when the Group has the intent and ability to hold it until maturity.
Held-to-maturity investments include term deposits (including treasury bills and promissory notes), bonds, preferred
shares with a mandatory buyback provision at a specified future date, and loans held to maturity with the objective of
earning periodic interest, as well as other held-to-maturity investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price and transaction costs related
to acquiring the investment. After initial recognition, these investments are measured at their recoverable amount.
Interest income from held-to-maturity investments after purchase is recognized in the income statement on an accrual ■
basis. Any interest received prior to the Group holding the investment is deducted from the purchase price at the time
of acquisition.
If there is clear evidence that part or all of the investment may not be recoverable and the loss is reliably measurable,
the loss is recognized as a financial expense in the year and directly reduces the investment's carrying value.
Investments in Joint Ventures and Associates '
Joint Venture
A joint venture is an entity established based on an agreement between the Company and other parties, where the
parties involved undertake economic activities based on joint control. Joint control is understood as the shared
decision-making process regarding the strategic policies related to the operation and financial policies of the joint
venture, which requires the agreement of all parties involved.
Associate
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence but does not have control over its financial and
operational policies. Significant influence is evidenced by the right to participate in decisions related to the financial
and operational policies of the investee, but without control or joint control over these policies.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price or capital
contribution and any directly related costs of the investment. In the case of investments made with non-monetary
assets, the investment is recorded at the fair value of the non-monetary asset at the time of the transaction.
Dividends and profits from periods prior to the investment purchase are deducted from the carrying value of the
investment. Dividends and profits from periods after the purchase of the investment are recognized as revenue.
Dividends received in the form of shares are only tracked by the number of shares issued, without recognizing the
value of the received shares.
A provision for loss on investments in joint ventures and associates is established when the joint venture or associate
incurs losses. The provision amount is determined by the difference between the actual capital contributions made by
the parties in the joint venture or associate and the actual equity of the entity, multiplied by the Group's ownership
percentage compared to the total capital contributions of all parties involved in the joint venture or associate.
The Parent Company’s investment in Sea Saigon Waterway Transport Joint Venture is valued at 1,224,000 USD,
equivalent to 51% of the charter capital. This investment is presented at cost due to the Sea Saigon Waterway
Transport Joint Venture being in the process of undergoing bankruptcy procedures.
Investments in Equity Instruments of Other Entities
Investments in equity instruments of other entities include investments in equity instruments where the Group does not
have control joint control, or significant influence over the investee.
Investments in equity instillments of other entities are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price or
capital contribution and any direct costs related to the investment activity. Dividends and profits from periods prior to
the investment purchase are deducted from the carrying value of the investment. Dividends and profits from periods
after the purchase of the investment are recognized as revenue. Dividends received in the form of shares are only
tracked by the number of shares issued, without recognizing the value of the received shares.
A provision for loss on investments in equity instruments of other entities is recognized as follows:• For investments in listed shares or when the fair value of the investment can be reliably determined, the
provision is based on the market value of the shares.
• For investments where the fair value cannot be reliably determined at the reporting date, the provision is based
on the investee's losses, with the provision amount calculated as the difference between the actual capital
contributions of the parties in the other entity and the actual equity of the entity, multiplied by the Group's
ownership percentage in relation to the total capital contributions of all parties in the other entity.
The increase or decrease in the provision for loss on investments in equity instillments of other entities that needs to
be recognized at the end of the financial year is recorded as a financial expense.
4.5 . Receivables
Receivables are reported at their cost less provision for doubtful debts.
The classification of receivables into trade receivables and other receivables is made based on the following principles:
• Trade receivables reflect amounts due from transactions of a commercial nature arising from buy-sell
activities between the Group and independent third parties, including receivables for sales of goods on
consignment to other entities.
• Intercompany receivables reflect amounts due from subsidiaries that do not have legal status or separate
accounting. J
« Other receivables reflect amounts due that are non-commercial and unrelated to buying and selling '4
transactions. J
The provision for doubtful debts reflects the estimated amount of loss due to receivables that are unlikely to be paid by
customers, based on the balance of receivables at the reporting date. The provision for doubtful debts is either I?
recognized or reversed through management expenses in the income statement. >^
4.6 . Inventory ^
Inventory is recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ^
The cost of inventory is determined as follows:
• Raw materials and goods: This includes the purchase cost and other directly related costs incurred to bring the
inventory to its current location and condition.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventory during normal production or business operations, less
the estimated costs to complete and the estimated necessary costs to sell the inventory.
Inventory is valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method and accounted for using the periodic inventory system.
Provision for Inventory Write-down
A provision for inventory write-down is made for each inventory item where the cost exceeds the net realizable value.
For unfinished services, the provision for write-down is calculated based on each type of service with a distinct price.
The increase or decrease in the provision for inventory write-down at the end of the financial year is recognized as
part of the cost of goods sold.
4.7 . Prepaid Expenses
Tools and Equipment
Tools and equipment that have been put into use are amortized over a period not exceeding 2 years using the straight-
line method.
Fixed Asset Repair Costs
Repair costs for fixed assets that do not meet the criteria for capitalizing as part of the asset’s cost are expensed. These
costs are amortized over a period not exceeding 3 years.
4.8 . Tangible Fixed Assets
Tangible fixed assets are recorded at their original cost, less accumulated depreciation. The original cost of tangible
fixed assets includes all costs inclined by the Group to acquire the asset and bring it to the condition necessary for use.
Costs incurred after initial recognition are added to the original cost of the asset only if these costs are expected to
increase the economic benefits from the use of the asset in the future. Costs that do not meet this condition are
recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When selling or disposing of an asset, the original cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the financial
statements, and any resulting gains or losses are recognized in the income statement.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
assets, as follows:
Buildings and structures 10-50 years
Machinery and equipment 3-15 yearsVehicles, transport and communication equipment 5-15 years
Office equipment 3-5 years
Other fixed assets 5 years
4.9 . Intangible Fixed Assets
Intangible fixed assets are recognized at their original cost, less accumulated amortization.
The original cost of intangible fixed assets includes all costs incurred by the Group to acquire the asset and bring it to
a state where it is ready for use. Costs related to intangible fixed assets incurred after initial recognition are expensed
in the period unless these costs are directly associated with a specific intangible asset and increase the economic
benefits derived from the asset.
When an intangible asset is sold or disposed of, the original cost and accumulated amortization are removed from the
financial statements, and any resulting gains or losses from disposal are recognized in income or expenses for the year.
Land Use Rights
Land use rights represent all the actual costs incurred by the Group related to land use, including the cost to acquire
land use rights, compensation for land clearance, ground leveling, and registration fees.
Land use rights with no term are not depreciated. For land use rights with a term, the depreciation period is the period
during which the Group is permitted to use the land. The Group's land use rights are depreciated over 50 years.
Computer software
The purchase price of computer software that is not a part of the related hardware is capitalized. The original cost of
computer software is the total cost that the Group has incurred up to the time the software is put into use. Computer
software is amortized on a straight-line basis over 3-5 years.
4.10 Investment property ^
Investment property is the right to use land, buildings, part of buildings or infrastructure owned by the Group or
finance leased for the purpose of earning rental income or waiting for capital appreciation. Investment property is
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of investment property is the total cost that the Group has to pay
or the fair value of the consideration given to acquire the investment property up to the time of purchase or completion
of construction.
Expenditures related to investment property incurred after initial recognition are recorded as expenses, unless these
costs arc likely to make the investment property generate economic benefits in the future in excess of the originally
assessed level of performance, then they are recorded as an increase in cost.
When investment property is sold, the cost and accumulated depreciation are written off and any gain or loss is
recorded as income or expenses in the period. Investment properties are depreciated using the straight-line method
over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Land Use Rights 50 years
Houses, Structures 5-50 years
4.11 Construction in progress
Construction in progress reflects costs directly related (including interest expenses related to loans in accordance with
the Group's accounting policies) to assets under construction, machinery and equipment being installed for production,
leasing and management purposes as well as costs related to repairs of fixed assets in progress. These assets arc
recorded at cost and are not depreciated.
Construction in progress is transferred to fixed assets when the project is completed, the overall acceptance is
completed, and the fixed assets are handed over and put into a state of readiness for use.
4.12 Liabilities and accrued expenses
Liabilities and accrued expenses are recognized for amounts to be paid in the future related to goods and services
received. Accrued expenses are recognized based on reasonable estimates of the amount to be paid.
The classification of payables as trade payables, accrued expenses and other payables is made according to the
following principles:
- Trade payables reflect commercial payables arising from transactions of purchasing goods, services, assets and the
seller is an independent entity of the Group, including payables when importing through a consignee.
- Accrued expenses reflect payables for goods and services received from the seller or provided to the buyer but not
yet paid due to lack of invoices or insufficient accounting records and documents, and payables to employees for
vacation wages, production and business expenses that must be accrued in advance.
- Internal payables reflect payables between the parent unit and the subordinate unit without legal status for dependent
accounting. ’- Other payables reflect payables that are not commercial in nature and not related to the purchase, sale, or provision
of goods and services.
4.13 Wages

reissuances of treasury shares are deducted from the share premium.
Funds
Funds are appropriated and utilized in accordance with the Company’s Charter.
4.16 Share premium
Profit after corporate income tax is distributed to shareholders after appropriations to funds in accordance with the
Company’s Charter and legal regulations, and upon approval by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
The distribution of profit to shareholders takes into account non-cash items included in undistributed post-tax profits
that may impact cash flows and the Company’s ability to pay dividends, such as gains from the revaluation of assets
contributed as capital, gains from the revaluation of monetary items, financial instruments, and other non-cash items.
Dividends are recognized as liabilities when approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
4.16 Profit distribution
Profit after corporate income tax is distributed to shareholders after setting aside funds in accordance with the
Company's Charter as well as the provisions of law and approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
The distribution of profits to shareholders takes into account non-monetary items in undistributed profit after tax that
may affect cash flow and the ability to pay dividends such as interest from revaluation of assets contributed as capital,
interest from revaluation of monetary items, financial instruments and other non-monetary items.
Dividends are recognized as liabilities when approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
4.17 Revenue
Sales revenue
Sales revenue is recognized when all five (5) following conditions are met:
(a) The Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;
(b) The Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor
effective control over the goods sold;
(c) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
(d) It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and
(e) The costs incurred or to be inclined in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue from rendering of services
Revenue from a transaction involving the rendering of services is recognized when the outcome of the transaction can
be measured reliably. Where a transaction involving the rendering of services is spread over several periods, revenue
is recognized in each period based on the percentage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date of that
period. The outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of services is recognized when all four (4) of the
following conditions are met:
(a) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;illI
(b) It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity;
(c) The stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured reliably; and
(d) The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably.
Operating Lease Revenue
Operating lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental payments received in
advance for multiple periods are allocated to revenue in accordance with the lease term.
Interest
Interest is recognized on an accrual basis, determined based on the balance of deposit accounts and the actual interest
rate for each period.
Dividends and distributed profits
Dividends and distributed profits are recognized when the Company is entitled to receive dividends or profits from
capital contributions. Dividends received in the form of shares are only tracked by the number of shares increased, not
the value of the shares received
4.18 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs include interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing.
Borrowing costs are recognized as expenses when incurred. In cases where borrowing costs are directly related to the
investment in construction or production of unfinished assets that take a long enough period (over 12 months) to be ।
put to use for the intended purpose or for sale, these borrowing costs are capitalized. For separate loans seizing the ||
construction of fixed assets, investment real estate, borrowing interest is capitalized even if the construction period is
less than 12 months. Income arising from temporary investment of loans is recorded as a reduction in the original cost
of related assets.
For general loans in which there is an investment in construction or production of unfinished assets, the capitalized
borrowing costs are determined according to the capitalization rate corresponding to the weighted average cumulative
costs incurred for the investment in construction or production of that asset. The capitalization rate is calculated at the
weighted average interest rate of the borrowings not yet paid during the year, except for specific borrowings serving
the purpose of forming a specific asset.
4.19 Corporate Income Tax
Corporate income tax expenses include current corporate income tax and deferred corporate income tax.
Current Corporate Income Tax
Current corporate income tax is calculated based on taxable income. Taxable income differs from accounting profit
due to adjustments for temporary differences between taxes and accounting treatments, non-deductible expenses,
adjustments for non-taxable income, and loss carry forwards.
Deferred Corporate Income Tax
Deferred corporate income tax refers to the corporate income tax payable or recoverable in the future due to temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases.
Deferred corporate income tax liabilities arc recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred corporate
income tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to utilize the
deductible temporary differences.
The carrying amount of deferred corporate income tax assets is reviewed at the end of the financial year and is
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow the benefits
of part or all of the deferred tax assets to be utilized. Previously unrecognized deferred corporate income tax assets are
reassessed at the end of the financial year and recognized when it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profits will
be available to utilize these unrecognized deferred tax assets.
Deferred corporate income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the tax rates expected to apply in the year
when the assets are realized or the liabilities are settled, based on the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
end of the financial year.
Deferred corporate income tax is recognized in the income statement, except when it relates to items recognized
directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognized directly in equity.
Offsetting Deferred Corporate Income Tax Assets and Liabilities
Deferred corporate income tax assets and liabilities are offset when:
- The Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities;
and- The deferred corporate income tax assets and liabilities relate to corporate income taxes levied by the same tax
authority:
• For the same taxable entity; or
• The Group intends to settle current income tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle
the liabilities simultaneously in each future period in which significant amounts of defened corporate income tax
liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.
The Group's tax reports are subject to review by tax authorities. Due to the application of tax laws to various
transactions and the differences in interpretation, understanding, and acceptance, the figures in the financial statements
may differ from those determined by the tax authorities.
4.20 Basic Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit after corporate income tax attributable to ordinary equity
shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
4.21 Segment Reporting ^
A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group engaged in the production or provision of goods or S
services and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is a distinguishable component of the Group engaged in the production or provision of goods
or services within a particular economic environment and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of
segments operating in other economic environments. )N
4.22 Financial Instruments | C?
Financial Assets
The classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the
time of initial recognition. The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, and other
receivables.
At the time of initial recognition, financial assets are recorded at cost plus any transaction costs directly attributable to
the financial asset.
Financial Liabilities
The classification of financial liabilities depends on the nature and purpose of the financial liabilities and is
determined at the time of initial recognition. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade payables, accrued expenses,
and other payables.
At the time of initial recognition, except for financial liabilities related to finance leases and convertible bonds which
are recorded at amortized cost, other financial liabilities are initially recorded at cost, less any transaction costs
directly attributable to the financial liability.
The amortized cost of a financial liability is determined by taking the initial carrying amount of the financial liability,
subtracting principal repayments, and adding or subtracting the cumulative amortization calculated using the effective
interest method for the difference between the initial carrying amount and the maturity value. It also subtracts any
reductions (directly or through a provision account) due to impairment or uncollectibility.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability or a group of
financial liabilities and allocating interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest
rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the
financial instrument, or a shorter period if applicable, to the net present carrying amount of the financial liability.
Equity Instruments
An equity instrument is a contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its
liabilities.
Offsetting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis in the balance sheet only when and only
if the Group:
- Has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts; and
- Intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

8. Financial Instruments
The Group holds financial assets such as receivables from customers, other receivables, cash, and short-term deposits
arising directly from its operations. The Group's financial liabilities mainly include loans, payables to suppliers, and
other payables. The primary purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise financial resources for the Group's
activities.
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
Risk management activities are essential to the Group’s overall business operations. The Group has developed a
control system to ensure a reasonable balance between the costs incurred when risks arise and the costs of risk
management. The Group has not implemented measures to mitigate these risks due to the lack of a market for
financial instruments.The Board of Directors reviews and agrees on the application of management policies for the above-mentioned risks
as follows:
7. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes
in market prices. Market risk includes four types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk, and
other price risks, such as equity price risk.
The sensitivity analysis presented below relates to the Group’s financial position as of March 31, 2025, and January 1,
2024.
This sensitivity analysis is prepared based on the value of net liabilities, with the ratio of fixed-rate debt to floating­
rate debt remaining unchanged.
The Group buys and sells derivative instruments and also incurs financial liabilities to manage market risk. All these
transactions are conducted within the guidelines of the risk management policy.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to
changes in market interest rates. The market risk arising from changes in the Group's interest rates mainly concerns
cash, short-term deposits, and the Group's borrowings. The Group manages interest rate risk by analyzing market
competition to secure favorable interest rates for its purposes while staying within its risk management limits.
Foreign Exchange Risk
Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to .
changes in exchange rates. The Group is exposed to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates that directly affect its
business operations. I
The Group faces foreign exchange risk from transactions involving the purchase, sale, and borrowing of currencies /
other than the Group's functional currency, primarily VND, and additionally, USD. The currencies involved in these^
transactions are mainly VND and USD.
The Group manages foreign exchange risk by maintaining the risk at an acceptable level through the purchase or sale
of foreign currencies at spot rates, as necessary, to address any short-term exchange rate risk exceeding the acceptable
limit.
As of March 31, 2025, the Group holds net monetary assets/liabilities that are exposed to foreign exchange risk as
follows:
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Receivables from Customers 189.676.47 USD
Equity Price Risk
The shares held by the Group are affected by market risks arising from the uncertainty of the future value of the
invested shares. The Group manages equity price risk by setting investment limits. The Group’s Board of Directors
also reviews and approves investment decisions regarding shares. The Group assesses the equity price risk as
insignificant.
Real Estate Risk
The Group has identified the following risks related to its real estate investment portfolio: (i) development project
costs may increase if there are delays in the planning process. The Group hires specialized consultants for specific
planning requirements within the scope of each project to mitigate risks during the planning process; (ii) the risk that
the fair value of the real estate investment portfolio may fluctuate due to market fundamentals and buyer-related
factors.
ii. Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that a party involved in a financial instrument or contract fails to fulfill its obligations, leading to
financial losses. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its business activities (primarily from receivables from
customers) and from its financial activities, including bank deposits and other financial instruments.
Receivables from Customers
The Group regularly monitors outstanding receivables. For major customers, the Group reviews the credit quality of
each customer at the reporting date. The Group aims to maintain strict control over overdue receivables and assigns
credit control staff to minimize credit risk. Based on this, and the fact that the Group’s receivables are spread across
various customers, the credit risk is not significantly concentrated on any single customer.Bank Deposits
The Group primarily maintains deposit balances with well-known banks in Vietnam. The credit risk of deposit
balances is managed by the Group's treasury department in accordance with the Group's policies. The maximum credit
risk of the Group related to the items on the balance sheet as of the financial year-end is the carrying value as
presented in Note 5.1. The Group considers the credit risk concentration of its bank deposits to be low.
Hi Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in fulfilling its financial obligations due to a lack of
funds. The liquidity risk of the Group primarily arises from the need to settle financial liabilities that have different
due dates.
The Group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash flows and maintaining a balance between short-term funds and
the cash needed for operations. The Group's management ensures that the cash flow requirements of the Group are
met to reduce liquidity risk and minimize the impact of cash flow fluctuations.

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities was not formally evaluated and determined as of March 31,
2025, and January 1, 2025. However, the Board of Directors assessed that the fair value of financial assets and
financial liabilities does not significantly differ from their book value as recorded at the financial year-end.
(2 ) Basis for Determining Fair Value
Receivables from Customers and Other ReceivablesThe fair value of receivables from customers and other receivables, including construction contract receivables and
payables, is calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using applicable discount rates reflective of
current market rates as of the reporting date. The fair value of these items is determined primarily for disclosure
purposes.
Derivative Instruments
The fair value of derivative contracts is based on quoted market prices, if available. If no quoted market price is
available, the fair value is calculated using discounted cash flow analysis based on the difference between the
contractual interest rate and the current market rate for the remaining maturity of the contract. The calculation also
considers credit risk adjustments. The fair value of these instruments is determined for disclosure purposes.
Financial Liabilities from Derivatives
The fair value, determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future cash flows using
applicable interest rates as of the reporting date. For convertible bonds, the market interest rate is determined by
referencing comparable instruments and adjusted for credit risk. For financial tax liabilities, market interest rates are
determined based on comparable forward contracts.
v. Risk Hedging
The Group does not apply hedge accounting policies.
