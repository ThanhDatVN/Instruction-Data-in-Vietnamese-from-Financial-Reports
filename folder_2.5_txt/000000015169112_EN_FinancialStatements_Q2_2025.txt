IV. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1. Accounting convention
AH the Financial Statements are prepared on the accrual basis (except for the information related to
cash flows).
2. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand and cash in bank. Cash equivalents are short-term investments of which
the due dates do not exceed 3 months from the dates of the investments that are readily convertible
into known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value as of the
balance sheet date.
3. Held-to-maturity investments
Investments are classified as held-to-maturity investments that the Company intends and is able to
hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments of the Company include held-to-maturity term deposits
for the purpose of receiving periodical interest.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at costs. After initial recognition, these
investments are recorded at recoverable value. Interest from these held-to-maturity investments after

Interest incurred prior to the Company’s acquisition of held-to-maturity investments is deducted into
the costs at the acquisition time.
When there is reliable evidence proving that a part or the whole investment cannot be recovered and
the loss is reliably measured, the loss is recognized as financial expenses during the period and
directly deducted into the investment costs.

following principles:
• Trade receivables reflect receivables concerning the commercial nature arising from purchase and
sale transactions between the Company and customers who are independent to the Company.
• Other receivables reflect receivables not concerning the commercial nature and irrelevant to
purchase and sale transactions.
Allowance is made for each doubtful debt on the basis of the ages of debts after offsetting against
liabilities (if any) or estimated loss as follows:
• As for overdue debts:
30% of the value of debts overdue between 6 months and less than 1 year.

incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and conditions.
• For finished goods, work-in-process: Costs comprise costs of materials, direct labor and directly
relevant general manufacturing expenses allocated on the basis of normal operations.
Stock-out costs are determined in accordance with the moving average method and recorded in line
with the perpetual method.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of inventories in the ordinary course of business less
the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Allowance for devaluation of inventories is recognized for each type of inventories when their costs
are higher than their net realizable values. Increases/decreases in the obligatory allowance for
devaluation of inventories as of the balance sheet date are recorded into costs of sales.
6. Prepaid expenses
Prepaid expenses comprise actual expenses incurred and relevant to financial performance in several
accounting periods. Prepaid expenses of the Company mainly include expenses on quarry exploration
incurred in connection with the expansion of the quarry. These expenses are allocated to costs during
the period on the basis of actual output volume and the remaining exploitation term.
7. Operating leased assets
A lease is classified as an operating lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident
to ownership belonging to the lessor. The lease expenses are allocated in the Company’s operation
costs in accordance with the straight-line method over the lease term and do not depend on the method
of lease payment.
8. Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are determined by their historical costs less accumulated depreciation. Historical
costs of tangible fixed assets include all the expenses paid by the Company to bring the asset to its
working condition for its intended use. Other expenses arising subsequent to initial recognition are
included into historical costs of fixed assets only if it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure
has resulted in future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of these assets. Those
which do not meet the above conditions will be recorded into operation costs during the period.
When a tangible fixed asset is sold or disposed, its historical cost and accumulated depreciation are
written off, then any gain or loss arising from such disposal is included in the income or the expenses
during the period.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated in accordance with the straight-line method over their estimated
useful lives. The depreciation years applied are as follows:
Fixed assets Years
Buildings and structures 05 - 50
Machinery and equipment 03 - 20
Vehicles 06 - 30
Office equipment 03 - 07
Other tangible fixed assets 04

9. Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are determined by their initial costs less accumulated amortization
The Company’s intangible fixed asset includes accounting software. Expenses attributable to the
accounting software, which is not a part associated with the relevant hardware, will be capitalized.
Costs of accounting software include all the expenses paid by the Company until the date the software
is put into use and upgrade costs to enhance software usability. The accounting software is amortized
in accordance with the straight-line method in 3 years.
When an intangible fixed asset is sold or disposed, its initial costs and accumulated amortization are
written off, then any gain or loss arising from such disposal is included in the income or the expenses
during the period.
10. Construction-in-progress
Construction-in-progress reflects the expenses (including relevant loan interest expenses following the
accounting policies of the Company) directly attributable to assets under construction, machinery and
equipment under installation for purposes of production, leasing and management as well as the repair
of fixed assets in progress. These assets are recorded at historical costs and not depreciated.
11. Payables and accrued expenses
Payables and accrued expenses are recorded for the amounts payable in the future associated with the
goods and services received. Accrued expenses are recorded based on reasonable estimates for the
amounts payable.
The classification of payables as trade payables, accrued expenses and other payables is made on the
basis of following principles:
• Trade payables reflect payables of commercial nature arising from the purchase of goods, services,
or assets, of which the seller is an independent entity with the Company.
• Accrued expenses reflect expenses for goods, services received from suppliers or supplied to
customers but have not been paid, invoiced or lack of accounting records and supporting
documents; pay on leave payable to employees; and accrual of operation expenses.
• Other payables reflect payables of non-commercial nature and irrelevant to purchase, sales of
goods or provisions of services.
The payables and accrued expenses are classified as short-term and long-term items in the Balance
Sheet on the basis of their remaining term as of the balance sheet date.
12. Provisions for payables
Provisions are recorded when the Company has present obligations (legal or constructive) as a result
of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If time causes material effects, the provisions will be determined by deducting the amount to be spent
in future to settle the liability at the pre-tax discount rate that reflects the assessments of the time value
of money and the specific risks from this liability in the current market.
The Company’s provisions for payables include those for environment restoration, which are made for
the quarries being exploited at the annually deposited amount as required.
13. Owner’s equity
Owner’s capital
The contributed capital is recorded according to the actual amounts invested by shareholders.

Deferred income tax is the amount of corporate income tax payable or refundable due to temporary
differences between book values of assets and liabilities serving the preparation of the Financial
Statements and the values for tax purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all the
temporary taxable differences. Deferred income tax assets are recorded only when there is an
assurance on the availability of assessable income in the future against which the temporarily
deductible differences can be used.
Carrying values of deferred corporate income tax assets are considered as of the balance sheet date and
will be reduced to the rate that ensures enough assessable income against which the benefits from part
of or all of the deferred income tax can be used. Deferred corporate income tax assets, which have not
been recorded before, are considered as of the balance sheet date and are recorded when there is
certainly enough assessable income to use these unrecognized deferred corporate income tax assets.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are determined at the estimated rate to
be applied in the year when the assets are recovered or the liabilities are settled based on the effective
tax rates as of the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is recognized in the Income Statement. In

liabilities; and

are paid or recovered.
