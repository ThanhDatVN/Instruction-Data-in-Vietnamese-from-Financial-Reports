accordance with lease contract. Such prepaid rental is classified as long-term prepaid
expenses for allocation to the consolidated income statement over the remaining lease
period, according to Circular 45.
3.11 Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of a business
combination is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued, and
liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange plus any costs directly attributable to
the business combination. Identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed
in a business combination are measured initially at fair values at the date of business
combination.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost being the excess of
the cost the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the
acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of a business
combination is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the
difference is recognized directly in the interim consolidated income statement. After initial
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated amortization. Goodwill is
amortized over 10-year period on a straight-line basis. The parent company conducts the
periodical review for impairment of goodwill of investment in subsidiaries. If there are
indicators of impairment loss incurred is higher than the yearly allocated amount of goodwill
on the straight-line basis, the higher amount will be recorded in the inteirm consolidated
income statement.

a transaction which at the time of the related transaction affects neither the accounting
profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
> in respect of taxable temporarily differences associated with investments in associates,
and interests in joint ventures where timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can
be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

credit and unused tax losses can be utilized, except:

utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available
to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Previously unrecognized
deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each balance sheet date and are recognized to the
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax assets
to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws
that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the interim consolidated income statement, except when ■:

Group to off-set current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income
taxes levied on the same taxable entity by the same taxation authority on:
k- either the same taxable entity; or
* ► when the Company intends either settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis

which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled (
or recovered.
3.21 Related parties
Parties are considered to be related parties of the Group if one party has the ability to control
the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and
operating decisions, or when the Group and other party are under common control or under
common significant influence. Related parties can be enterprises or individuals, including
close members of their families.
3.22 Segment information
A segment is a component determined separately by the Group which is engaged in providing
products or related services (business segment) or providing products or services in a
particular economic environment (geographical segment), that is subject to risks and returns
that are different from those of other segments.
The Group’s activities are mainly taking place within Vietnam. The Group's principal activities
are to manufacture, process and trade wooden household furniture; to manufacture sanitary
products from porcelain and to plant forest. Therefore, the Group’s risks and returns are not
impacted by the Group’s confectionary products or the locations that the Group is trading. As
a result, management is of the view that there is only one segment for business and
geography and therefore presentation of segmental information is not required.
