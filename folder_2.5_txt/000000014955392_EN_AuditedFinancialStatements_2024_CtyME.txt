Auditor’s responsibility CHÍNH KI
ÂK1ÈMT
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Separate Financial Statements based on conducting our audit. PHUm
We conducted our audit in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing. However, due to the matter c7p7i<
described in the "Basis for disclaimer of audit opinion" paragraph, we were not able to obtain sufficient '~ ■
appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Basis for Disclaimer of Audit opinion
At the time of this report issuance, we had not received the confirmation letters concerning the following items:
Short-term Trade Receivables is VND 301 billion; Short-term Prepayments from Customers is VND 270 billion;
Short-term Advances and Other Receivables totaling VND 227,627,728,734 (with Advances confirmed at 34% and
Other Receivables at 68%); Short-term Trade Payables is VND 96,125,581,885; Short-term Prepayments to
INGTY
Suppliers VND 85 billion; and Short-term Other Payables is VND 42 billion. The Company has also not yet
ẤNĐẨI
assessed the recoverability or determined losses for these receivables. By performing alternative audit procedures,
OGI
we were also unable to express an opinion on the accuracy of the aforementioned items. Therefore, we are unable to
determine whether these adjustments should be made in the Separate Financial Statements.
Regarding the investment cooperation with Industrial Development Co., Ltd., valued at VND 31 billion (not yet
confirmed) as presented in Note V.4 on page 29 of the Separate Financial Statement. In addition, other equity
investments according to the contracts from 2014 until now has expired, but the parties have not fulfilled the
commitments as stipulated in the contracts. We are also unable to obtain the relevant documentation to determine
whether the parties continue to perform their commitments, and we are unable to assess the recoverability of the
invested funds and determine whether adjustments should be made in the Separate Financial Statements.
At the end of the fiscal year on December 31, 2024, we were not able to witness the inventory count, and through
alternative audit procedures, we were also unable to confirm the existence of this asset. Consequently, we could not
determine the necessary adjustments to these balances. In addition, the company has a quantity of finished tiles and
modly tiles that are unusable, held in inventory for an extended period with slow turnover, with a total value of
VND 31.9 billion. The company has not determined the net realizable value of these goods to make provision for
devaluation of inventories according to VAS No. 02 - "Inventory". We were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate
audit evidence to evaluate and determine the net realizable value of the inventory; therefore, we could not determine
whether adjustments to these figures are necessary.

feasibility of continuing the project, assess the net realizable value, or determine the recoverability of this
investment.
Regarding the service revenue from providing services to PT. Sumber Glober Energy TBK in 2024, the company
recognized in advance the brokerage service revenue for shipments expected to be completed in early 2025;
specifically, the service revenue according to Contract No. TSAPLB01-010125VN dated January 8, 2025. In
addition, the company has not yet paid the bank interest expenses, which will affect the taxable income reported in

5. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings, trade and other payables. The main
purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations. The Company has loans and ^®
receivables, trade and other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that arise directly from its operatimi
The Company also hold available-for-sale investment. ^ Tljfe |
The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. ^7^ I
Risk management is integral to the whole business of the Group. The Company has a system of controls in^pface
to create an acceptable balance between the cost of risks occurring and the cost of managing the risksTThe
management continually monitors the Company's risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance
between risk and control is achieved.
The Board of Management consider and apply management policies for these risks as follows:
5.1. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or cash flows in the future of a financial instrument will fluctate due'io *
changes in the market prices. The market risks include foregin currency risk, interest risk and material price riskyCfZ
Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans, common bonds, convertible bonds, deposits arijf'
financial investments.
The sensitivity analyses below are on the basis of net debt value, the ratio between debt at fixed interest rates and
loans at floating interest rates unchanged.
a. Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctate due to
changes in exchange rate. Foreign currency risks of the Company are mainly related to the the Company’s
operations (when revenue or expenses derived from foreign currencies have difference of the Company's the
functional currency).
Foreign currency sensitivity
As the Company was established and operates in Vietnam, with its reporting currency being the Vietnamese
Dong, the primary transaction currency of the Company is also the Vietnamese Dong. Therefore, the Company’s
foreign currency risk is not material. As at the end of the accounting period, the Company had an insignificant
foreign currency balance; hence, no sensitivity analysis for foreign currency was performed.
b. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctate due to changes
in market inter set rates.
The Company’s interest rate risk substantially relates to term deposits and loans at floating interest rates.
The Company controls the interest rate risk by analyzing the market situation on order to give best rate.
The Company did not perform a sensitive analysis on interest rate risk because changes in interest rates at the
reporting date are not insignificant.

c. Price risk
Share price risk:
The listed and non-listed shares are affected by the market risk arising from uncertainty value in the future, henc^
provisions for investment have increased or decreased. The Company manage price risk by setting investment
limit. The Board of Management also consider and approve investment decision in shares.
The Company will analyze and present the sensitivity due to the impact of fluctuation in share price to operating
results when they has instructions by the Authorities.
Real estate price risks:
The Company has identified the following risks related to its real estate investment portfolio:
- The costs of development projects may increase in the event of delays during the planning process. To mitigate /
this risk, the Company engages consultants specializing in specific planning requirements within the project scopeX^
to reduce potential risks that may arise during the planning phase. I 9/
- The fair value risk of the real estate investment portfolio due to fundamental market factors and buyers. P M
5.2. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer V
contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily
for trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks, foreign exchange
transactions and other financial instruments.
a. Trade receivables
The Company minimizes credit risk by dealing only with the customers that have good financial resources.
Besides, the accountants follow up the account receivables regularly to speed up the recovery. Trade receivables
of the Company are related to various entities and therefore the credit risk exposed from trade receivables is low.
b. Cash in bank
Most of the Company's cash in bank is in the large and trusted banks in Vietnam. Credit risk to this balance at the
bank is managed by the treasury department of the Company in accordance with Company policy. The Company
does not realize any material credit risk to this cash in bank.
5.3. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations asscociated with financial
liabilities. The Company's liquidity risk mainly arise from the differences in maturity dates of financial assets and
financial liabilities.
The Board of Management is responsible for managing liquidity risk. The most major payables are secured by
deposits, receivables and short-term assets. The Company did not perform a sensitive analysis on liquidity risks
because concentration on liquid risks are low.
The Company's approach to control this risk: regularly following up the currency payment requests as well as
estimated payment requests in the future to maintain an appropriate amount of cash and loans, supervising the
cash flows actually arisen in comparison with estimation to minimize the effect of the changes in the cash flows
to the Company.

The Company has not assessed the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities at the end of the final
accounting period due to Circular 210/2009/TT-BTC issued by the Ministry of Finance on November 6, 2009, as
well as the current regulations lacking specific guidelines on determining the fair value of financial assets and
financial liabilities. Circular 210/2009/TT-BTC requires the application of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) for the presentation of financial statements and disclosure of information regarding financial
instruments, but does not provide equivalent guidance for the assessment and recognition of financial instruments,
including the application of fair value, in compliance with IFRS.
