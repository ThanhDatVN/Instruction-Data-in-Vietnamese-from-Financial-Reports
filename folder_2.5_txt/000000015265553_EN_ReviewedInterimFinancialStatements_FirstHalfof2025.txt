To: Shareholders
The Board of Directors and Board of Management
Lam Thao Fertilizers and Chemicals JSC
We have reviewed the accompanying Interim Combined Financial Statements of Lam Thao Fertilizers
and Chemicals JSC (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”), prepared on July 28, 2025, from page 05
to page 35, including: Interim Combined Balance Sheet as at 30/6/2025, Interim Combined Income
Statement, Interim Combined Cash Flow Statement for the period then ended and Notes to the Interim
Combined Financial Statements.
Respective responsibilities of Board of Management
Board of Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and true & fair presentation of
the Interim Combined Financial Statements of Company in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting
Standards, Vietnamese Accounting regime for enterprises and legal regulations relating to the preparation
and presentation of the Interim Combined Financial Statements and for such internal control as Board of
Management determines is necessary to enable the presentation of Interim Combined Financial
Statements that are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud or error.
Respective responsibilities of Auditor
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the accompanying Interim Combined Financial
Statements based on our review. We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on
Review Engagement (VSRE) 2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the
Independent Auditor of the Entity.
A review of Interim Combined Financial Statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on
Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Auditor’s conclusion
Base on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
Interim Combined Financial Statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the Combined
financial position of the Company as at 30/6/2025, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for
the period then ended in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, Vietnamese Accounting
regime for enterprises and legal regulations related to the preparation and presentation of Interim
