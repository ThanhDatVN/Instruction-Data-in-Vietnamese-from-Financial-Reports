The Board of Management’s responsibility
The Board of Management of American Vietnamese Biotech Incorporation is responsible for the
preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese
Accounting Standards, Corporate Accounting System and legal regulations relating to preparation and
presentation of consolidated financial statements, and for such internal control as the Board of Management
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing. These standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by the Board of Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of (he
consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
qualified audit opinion.

Basis ior Qualified Opinion
- We were unable to observe the cash count as of December 31, 2024, for which the cash on hand was
VND 1,885,137,331 because we had not yet been appointed as the auditor at that time. Accordingly, we
do not express an opinion on the existence, accuracy, and completeness of cash as of 3 I December
2024.
- Certain associates have been established but have either not yet formed any assets or have formed
insignificant assets to support business operations. The total investment in these associates amounts to
VND 323,520,000,000 (as disclosed in Note V.I3). Based on the audit procedures performed, we were
unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to assess the reasonableness of these investments
or their impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year 2024.
- The parent company and its subsidiaries made advance payments for goods and services to suppliers
but had not received the corresponding goods or services in accordance with the terms of the contracts.
As of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, the Company had neither received
the goods nor recovered the advances, which amounted to VND 419,809,600,000 (VND
399,840,000,000 as at 01 January 2024). We performed additional audit procedures but were unable to
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to assess the recoverability of these advance payments at
the above-mentioned dates. Accordingly, we are unable to express an opinion on the recoverability of
these advances as at 31 December 2024, as well as its impact on the accompanying consolidated
financial statements of the Company.
- As at 31 December 2024, Viet My Medical Investment Joint Stock Company was cooperating in the
investment of a centralized medical waste treatment project with Sara Vung Tan Joint Stock Company,
amount of VND 61,717,000,000. As of (he date of issuance of this report, the project had not yet
completed the necessary procedures to commence operations. Based on our audit procedures, we were
unable to assess the effectiveness and recoverability of this investment, as well as its impact on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended 3 I December 2024.
- The Company has invested in and installed machinery, equipment, and the medical image storage and
transmission software system (RIS-PACS) according to lease and cooperation agreements with
hospitals and medical centers. The total investment as of 31 December 2024, amounted to VND
80,255,898,895 (of which VND 59,564,895,987 relates to assets handed over to hospitals for use, and
VND 20,691,002,908 relates to assets not yet handed over). Certain hospitals have generated revenue;
however, due to the lack of detailed and consistent guidance on payment for diagnostic imaging
technical services based on the PACS system, the Company does not yet have sufficient reliable basis
to fully determine the economic benefits arising from these leasing and cooperation arrangements.
Nevertheless, the Company has recognized depreciation expense for the handed-over assets in the
operating results of the years, with accumulated depreciation totaling VND 20,811,796,801 as of 3 1
December 2024 (of which VND 16,526,054,590 was accumulated as of 31 December 2023, and VND
4,285,742,211 was depreciation expense for year 2024). Based on (he audit procedures performed, we
were unable to determine the impact of these matters on the consolidated financial statements for the
year ended 3 1 December 2024.
- As at 31 December 2024, the value of construction in progress related to the procurement of
machinery and operating equipment in clinics amounted to VND 6,227,155,144. This amount has been
incurred for a long time but has not yet been accepted and handed over for use. Based on our audit
procedures, we were unable to estimate the fair value of this construction in progress expense as well as
assess its impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.
- As at 31 December 2024, the short-term loan receivables amounted to VND 48,133,050,000. Based
on our audit procedures, we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to assess the
recoverability of these loan receivables as at the aforementioned date. Accordingly, we do not express
an opinion on the recoverability of this loan as at 31 December 2024, as well as its impact on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company.

1. Basis for preparing Consolidated Financial Statements
Financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting (except for information relating to
cash flows).
The consolidated financial statements include the Financial Statements of American VietNamese
Biotech INC.(parent company) and subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the )
parent company. Control exists when the parent company has the power, directly or indirectly, to /
govern the financial and operating policies of a subsidiary so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In
assessing control, potential voting rights that arc currently exercisable or convertible are taken into
account.
The results of operations of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year arc presented in the
Consolidated Statement of Income from the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale of the
investment in that subsidiary.
In case the accounting policy of a subsidiary is different from (he accounting policy applied
consistently in the Group, the Financial Statements of the subsidiary will be appropriately adjusted
before being used for preparing (he Consolidated Financial Statements.
Balances of accounts on the Balance Sheet between companies in the same Group, intra-group
transactions, unrealized intra-group profits arising from these transactions arc eliminated when $
preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealized losses arising from intra-group Xi
transactions arc also eliminated unless the costs creating such losses are unrecoverable.

the parent company's shareholders and arc presented separately in the consolidated income statement ^
and consolidated balance sheet. Minority interests consist of the amount of the minority interests at the
date of the original business combination and (he minority's share of changes in equity since the date
of the combination. LossesThe minority interest in excess of its interest in (he subsidiary's equity is
deducted from the Group's interest unless the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make
good the loss.
2. Business combination
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the company are measured at their fair values at the
date of acquisition. Any Totalitional difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any negative difference between the purchase price and the
fair value of the assets acquired is recognised in the income statement for the period in which the
subsidiary is acquired.
Non-controlling interests at the date of the initial business combination arc measured based on the non­
controlling interest's share of the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
recognised.

in the value of the investment itself. Dividends and profits from periods subsequent to the investment
being purchased are recorded as revenue. Dividends received in shares arc only tracked by (he number
of shares increased, not the value of (he shares received/recorded at par value.
Provision for losses on investments in associates is made when the associate suffers a loss, with (he
provision equal to the difference between the actual capital contributions of the parties in (he joint
venture or associate and the actual equity multiplied by (he ratio of the Enterprise's capital contribution
to the total actual capital contributions of the parties in the associate. If the associate is the subject of

+ The Company's intangible fixed assets consist of software programs, including:
- Management software systems
- PASC system software (*)
(*) This refers to the RIS-PACS medical imaging storage and transmission system that the Company
has comprehensively installed to support medical examination, diagnostic imaging, and treatment. The
software, along with accompanying hardware, has been deployed at various medical facilities (general
hospitals and provincial/city medical centers) under installation and trial use agreements or business
cooperation contracts between the Company and those facilities. These systems have been accepted,
handed over, and put into operation.
At some hospitals, the system has generated revenue. I lowevcr, due to the lack of specific and
consistent guidance on payment mechanisms for diagnostic imaging services based on PACS systems,
the Company docs not yet have a reliable basis to fully determine the economic benefits expected
from leasing or business cooperation arrangements. Currently, the Company primarily generates
revenue from maintenance services, equipment servicing, and 24/7 technical support fees for the
PACS system.
Additionally, certain intangible fixed assets in the form of software programs, with a historical cost of
VND 36,639,885,600 and a net book value of VND 32,746,879,775, have been pledged as collateral
