of changes in market interest rates. Market risk for changes in interest rates of the Group primarily correlates to 3 ty
cash, short term deposits, bonds, and loans of the Group. han
G M;
The Group manages interest rate risk by analyzing the competitive situation in the market to acquire beneficial ¿ian<
interest for company’s purposes, but still remain within the limits of their risk management.
Foreign currency risk
The Group bears the risk of exchange rate due to fluctuation in fair value of future cash flows of a financial
instrument according to changes in exchange rates. The Group is exposed to the risk of exchange rate changes
directly related to its business operations.
The Group has foreign exchange risk from the purchase, sale and borrowings denominated in other currencies,
which are different from the accounting currency of the Group. The Group manages foreign currency risk by
considering the current market situation and expected when the Group plans to buy and sell in foreign currency
in the future.

in financial losses. The Group has credit risk from its operating activities (primarily for trade receivables

financial instruments.

considered the decline in the credit quality of each customer at the reporting date. The Group seeks the way to
remained the tight control of the receivables and arranging credit control staff to minimize credit risk. On this
basis and the trade receivables of the Group related to various customers, credit risk is not significantly
concentrated in a certain customer.
Cash in bank

balances at banks is managed by the treasury department of the Group policies. The maximum credit risk of the
Group for the items on the balance sheet at the end of the financial year is the value book presented in note No.
5.1. The Group found that the level of concentration of credit risk on bank deposits is low.

lack of funds. Liquidity risk of the Group mainly arises from maturity mismatches of financial assets and financial
liabilities.
The Group minimizes the liquidity risk by maintaining an amount of cash and cash equivalents and bank loans
at a level that the Board of General Directors believes it is sufficient to meet the Group's operations and
minimize the risks due to the volatility of cash flows. The table below summarizes the maturity of the financial
liabilities of the Group based on expected payments on undiscounted basic contracts:
