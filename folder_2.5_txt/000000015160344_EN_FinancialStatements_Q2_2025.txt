II. BASIS FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FISCAL YEAR
Basis for preparing financial statements
The accompanying interim financial statements, expressed in Vietnam Dong (VND), are prepared under the
historical cost convention and in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, accounting regime
applicable to credit institutions in Vietnam and legal regulations relating to interim financial reporting.
Vietnamese accounting system for credit institutions under circulaNo.l0/2014/TT-NHNN dated 20 March
2014 and System of financial statements for Vietnamese credit institutions under Decision No. 16/2007/QD-
NHNN dated 18 April 2007, circula No.49/2014/TT-NHNN dated 31 December 2014 and circula

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form: B05TCTD
For the period from January 1, 2025 to June 30, 2025 Unit: VND million
The accompanying interim financial statements are not intended to present the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows in accordance with accounting principles and practices which are generally
accepted in countries and jurisdictions other than Vietnam.
Fiscal year
The Bank’s financial year begins on 01 January and ends on 31 December.
III. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following are the main accounting policies applied by the Bank in preparing its own financial statements:
Accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements complies with accounting standards, accounting regimes applicable
to credit institutions in Vietnam and legal regulations related to the preparation and presentation of financial
statements that require the Board of Management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported
data on debts, assets and the presentation of liabilities and potential assets at the date of preparation of the
financial statements as well as reported figures on revenues and expenses throughout the fiscal year.
Although accounting estimates are made to the best of Board of Management's knowledge, the actual results
may differ from those set forth in the estimates and assumptions.
Foreign currency
According to the Bank’s accounting system, all the transactions are recorded in original currencies. At the
reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into VND
using the average buying and selling spot exchange rates at the end of the balance sheet date if the difference
between this rate and the weighted average exchange rate of buying and selling of the same day is less than
1%. In case the buying and selling spot exchange rate at the end date of the balance sheet date is greater
than or equal to 1% compared with the weighted average buying and selling spot exchange rate of that day,
the Bank uses the weighted average buying and selling spot exchange rates on the statement of financial
position date for conversion. Income and expenses arising in foreign currencies of the Bank are converted
into VND at exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates. At the end of the year, exchange rate differences
arising from the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into VND are
recorded in “Net gain/(loss) from foreign currency trading” in the statement of profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, gold, gemstones, precious metals, current accounts at the SBV,
treasury bills and other short-term valuable papers that are qualified for being discounted at the SBV,

current accounts and time deposits for term of three months or less from the deposit date and securities
investment with the original maturity of three months or less from the transaction date.
Placements with and loans to other credit institutions
Placements with and loans to other credit institutions are presented at their principal amounts outstanding
at the end of the financial year.
The credit risk classification for placements with and loans to other credit institutions are classified and
provisioned with Circular 31 and Decree 86. Accordingly, the Bank makes specific provisions for deposits
(except for current deposits at other domestic credit institutions and foreign bank branches, and placements
with Vietnam Bank for Social Policies following the regulations of the SBV on maintaining the balance of
deposits at Vietnam Bank for Social Policies of state credit institutions) at other credit institutions and
foreign bank branches as prescribed by law, and deposits (except for current deposits) at overseas credit
institutions in a similar way to those for loans to customers.
Derivatives
Foreign currency forward and swap contracts
For foreign currency forward and swap contracts, the difference between equivalent VND amounts of
foreign currency purchase/sale commitments using forward exchange rate and spot exchange rate as at
effective date of the contract is recognized immediately at the effective date of the contract in line “Interest
and fee receivables” item or “Interest and fee payables” item in the statement of financial position. The
difference is subsequently allocated to “Net gain/(loss) from foreign currency trading” item using straight-
line method over the term of the contract.
As at the date of the financial statements, commitments of foreign currency forward and swap contracts are
revaluated and exchange differences arising from the revaluation of foreign currency denominated balances
of forward contracts are recognized in the “Net gain/(loss) from foreign currency trading” item in the
statement of profit or loss.
Loans to customers
Loans to customers are disclosed and presented at their principal amounts outstanding at the end of the
reporting period.
Short-term loans are those with a repayment date within less than 1 year of the loan disbursement date.
Medium-term loans are those with a repayment date between 1 to 5 years of the loan disbursement date.
Long-term loans are those with a repayment date of more than 5 years from the loan disbursement date.

Investments
Investment securities
Available-for-sale securities
Available-for-sale securities include debt and equity securities that the Bank holds less than 20% of voting
rights for investment and ready-for-sale purposes. These securities are not frequently traded but can be sold
at any time once they are profitable, and the Bank is neither the founding shareholder/strategic partner nor
capable of controlling, to some extent, the process of initiating and approving financial and operational
policies of the investee through a written agreement on delegating personnel for representation in the Board
of Directors/Board of Management.
Available-for-sale equity securities are recognized at cost at the transaction date and subsequently recorded
at cost during the holding period. Available-for-sale debt securities are initially recognized at par value at
the transaction date. Accrued interest before the acquisition date (for debt securities with interest payment
in arrears) or interest income received upfront awaiting amortisation (for debt securities with interest
payment in advance) is recorded in a separate account. Any discount or premium, which is the difference
between the cost and the amount equal to par value plus (+) accrued interest before the acquisition date (if
any) or minus (-) interest received upfront awaiting amortisation (if any), is also recorded in a separate
account.
During the term of those securities, available-for-sale securities are recorded at par value minus/plus
remaining discount/premium after being amortised into the statement of profit or loss using the straight-line
method over the remaining term of securities. Interest payment in arrears is recorded as follows:
accumulative interest income before the purchasing date is deducted from the cost of such securities and
the same amount is credited into the accrued interest income; accumulative interest income after the
purchasing date is recognised as the Bank’s income on an accrual basis. Interest received upfront is
amortised into the statement of profit or loss using the straight-line method over the investment period.
Periodically, available-for-sale securities are subject to impairment review. Provision for securities that are
fallen within the scope of Decree 86 are made in accordance with Decree 86. Provision for impairment of
securities that are not fallen within the scope of Decree 86 are made when their carrying values are higher
than their market values determined in accordance with prevailing accounting regulations. Provision for
impairment is recorded in the statement of profit or loss as “Net gain/(loss) from investment securities”.
Transactions of debts purchasing between Vietnam Asset Management Company (“VAMC”) and other
credit institutions Special bonds issued by VAMC are term valuable papers issued by VAMC for purchasing
13PROSPERITY AND GROWTH COMMERCIAL JOINT STOCK BANK
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form: B05TCTD
For the period from January 1, 2025 to June 30, 2025 Unit: VND million
bad debts of the Bank.
The Bank accounts for bad debt sold in exchange for special bonds issued by VAMC in accordance with
guidance in Offcial Letter No. 8499/NHNN-TCKT issued by the SBV on 14 November 2013 (“Official
Letter 8499”) and Official Letter No. 925/NHNN-TCKT issued by the SBV on 19 February 2014 (“Official
Letter 925”). The special bonds are classified as held-to-maturity securities, initially measured at par value
at transaction date and subsequently measured at par value less allowance for losses.
For each bad debt amounts sold to VAMC, the Bank receives one special bond issued by VAMC. Par value
of special bonds equals to carrying amount of loan principal balance of the bad debt less specific allowance
made but not yet utilized for such bad debt.
Upon completing the procedures of selling bad debts, the Bank writes down the book value of the bad debts,
uses the specific allowance made but not yet utilized and derecognize interest receivables recorded in off-
balance sheet account. At the same time, the Bank recognizes special bonds issued by VAMC as held-to-
maturity securities issued by local economic entities.
For special bonds issued by VAMC, specific allowance is calculated and provided in accordance with the
guidance in Circular No. 19/2013/TT-NHNN dated 6 September 2013 issued by the SBV on the purchase,
sale, settlement of bad debts of VAMC (“Circular 19”) and Circular No. 14/2015/TT-NHNN dated 28
August 2015 issued by the SBV, Circular No. 08/2016/TT-NHNN dated 16 June 2016 issued by the SBV
and Circualr No. 09/2017/TT-NHNN dated 14 August 2017 issued by the SBV on amendments and
supplement to some articles of Circular 19.
Accordingly, the minimum specific allowance required to be provided each year during the term of special
bonds is the positive difference between the (Par value of the special bonds divided by the term of the bonds
multiplied with the number of accumulated years from the issuance date) less (The accumulated total debt
collecting amount of the relevant bad debts as of the provision date and the accumulated specific allowance
made as of the preceding provision date of the bonds). On an annual basis within 05 working days prior to
the corresponding date of the maturity date of special bonds, the Bank makes the above specific allowance
once and is not required to make general allowance for the special bonds.
Provision for special bonds is recognized in the statement of profit or loss of the Bank.
Reclassification
According to Official Letter No. 2601/NHNN-TCKT dated 14 April 2009 by the SBV, reclassification after
transaction date is made only once for each item of investment securities. In special cases or in case a large
number of securities has to be reclassified (greater than or equal to 50% of total value of the portfolio), the
Bank will disclose the effect of reclassification on total assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses of
the Bank in the financial statements.
Other long-term investments

neither have control nor significant influence. The investments are initially recognized at cost at the
transaction date and always carried at that cost during the subsequent holding period.
Provision for impairment of investments
Provision for impairment of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other long-term
investments is made when the investee is operating at loss in accordance with prevailing accounting
regulations.
Provision for impairment of long-term investments is recognized as an operating expense in the statement of
profit or loss. In case an investment is made in listed shares or the fair value of an investment is reliably
determined, the provision is made based on the market value of the stock (similar to the provision for
impairment of trading securities).
Recognition
The Bank recognizes investment securities and other investments at the date when contracts are signed and
effective (transaction-date based policy). Investment securities and other investments are initially
recognized at cost. After initial recognition, investment securities and other investments are recognized
under the above accounting policies.
Derecognition
Investments in securities are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments end
or when the Bank transfers to the buyer the significant risks and rewards associated with the ownership of
the investments.
Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase at a specific date in the future (repos) are recorded in the
financial statements. The corresponding cash receipt is recognized in the statement of financial position as
a liability. The difference between the sale price and the repurchase price is allocated to the statement of
profit or loss over the agreement validity period using the straight-line method based on the contractual
interest rate.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell at a specific date in the future (reverse repos) are not
recognized in the financial statements. The corresponding cash payment is recognized in the statement of
financial position as “Loans to customers”. The difference between the purchase price and resale price is
allocated to the statement of profit or loss over the agreement validity period using the straight-line method
based on the contractual interest rate.
Trust activities and trusted funds
The value of trusted funds is recorded when the trust contracts have been signed and trusted funds have
been realised. Rights and obligations of the trustor and trustee relating to profit and profit sharing, trust fee,
15PROSPERITY AND GROWTH COMMERCIAL JOINT STOCK BANK
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form: B05TCTD

other rights and obligations are in compliance with the terms of the signed contracts. The assets that are
held under custody services are not considered as assets of the Bank and therefore, they are not recognized
in the financial statements of the Bank.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of tangible fixed asset
comprises all the Bank’s purchase price plus any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the
working condition for its intended use.
Expenditures for additions, improvements and renewals are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance
and repairs are charged to the statement of profit or loss when incurred. When assets are sold or disposed,
their cost and accumulated depreciation are written off from the statement of financial position and any
gains or losses resulting from their disposals are recorded in the statement of profit or loss.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. The cost of an intangible asset comprises
all the Bank’s expenditures paid to acquire the asset until it is put into use.
Expenditures for improvements and renewals are capitalized; other expenditures are charged to the
statement of profit or loss when incurred. When intangible assets are sold or disposed, their cost and
accumulated amortisation are written off from the statement of financial position and any gains or losses
resulting from their disposals are recorded in the statement of profit or loss.
Leasing
A lease is classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
At the date of receiving the leased items, the Bank recognizes assets held under finance leases as fixed
assets and liabilities under finance leases in the statement of financial position at the fair value of the lease
assets or, if lower, at the net present value of the minimum lease payments. Finance lease payments are
divided into financial expenses, which comprises interest on finance lease and principal payable in each
period in equal instalments.
Finance lease assets are depreciated in the same way as applicable to other fixed assets of the same group
owned by the Bank. If there is uncertainty that the Bank will purchase the lease assets at the end of the lease
term, finance lease assets are depreciated over the lease term stated in the contracts or, if shorter, the useful
life of the lease assets.
Operating lease assets are recognized off statement of financial position. Rentals under operating leases are
recorded in “Other operating expenses” on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Machinery and equipment 5-7
Motor vehicles 8-10
Management tools and equipment 3-5

The cost of the land use rights is not amortized if it is granted by the Government of Vietnam for an
indefinite term. The cost of the land use rights with definite term is amortized over the granted term.
Prepayments
Prepayments include actual expenses that have arisen but are related to the results of production and
business activities of multiple accounting periods. Prepayments comprise prepaid office rentals and other
long-term prepaid expenses.
Office rentals represent the amounts which have been paid in advance. Prepaid office rental is charged to
the statement of profit or loss using the straight-line method over the rental period.
Other long-term prepayments include repair, maintenance costs for assets, costs of tools and supplies issued
for consumption, which are expected to provide future economic benefits to the Bank. These expenses are
capitalized as prepayments, and are allocated to the statement of profit or loss using the straight-line method
over the period of one year or more, but not exceeding three years in accordance with prevailing accounting
regulations.
Receivables
Receivables other than those from credit activities in the Bank’s operation are initially recognized at cost
and subsequently recorded at cost. Other receivables are subject to impairment review based on the overdue
status or based on the expected loss for the following cases: institutional debtors who have fallen into
bankruptcy or have been in the process of dissolution; or individual debtors who are missing, escaping,
prosecuted, on trial or passed away even though receivables are not overdue. Provision expense incurred is
recorded as “Operating expenses” in the statement of profit or loss during the year.
17PROSPERITY AND GROWTH COMMERCIAL JOINT STOCK BANK
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form: B05/TCTD
For the period from January 1, 2025 to June 30, 2025 Unit: VND million
Provision rates for overdue receivables are applied in accordance with the prevailing accounting
regulations.
Other provisions
Other provisions are recognized when the Bank has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is
probable that the Bank will be required to settle that obligation. Other provisions are measured at the
management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date.
Capital and reserves
Common shares
Common shares are classified as owners’ equity of the Bank.
Reserves
Reserves are used for specific purposes and are appropriated from the Bank’s profit after tax based on the
regulated ratios in the following sequence:
Charter capital supplementary reserve: 5% of profit after tax but not exceeding the Bank’s charter
capital;
Financial reserve fund: 10% of profit after tax;
Other reserves, if any, will be approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Shareholders’
Meeting.
Revenue and expenses
Interest income and interest expense
Income and expenses from interest on investments in securities are recorded on the accrual basis. Accrued

18PROSPERITY AND GROWTH COMMERCIAL JOINT STOCK BANK
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form: B05/TCTD
For the period from January 1, 2025 to June 30, 2025 Unit: VND million
Cash dividends and profits received from investment and capital contributions activities are recorded in the
statement of profit or loss when the Bank's right to receive dividends and profits has been established. Share
dividends, which are distributed from profits of joint stock companies, are recognized neither as an increase
in the value of received shares nor financial income in the financial statements but are only used for tracking
the increase in the number of shares according to Circular No. 22/2017/TT-BTC dated 29 December 2017
issued by the State Bank of Vietnam.
Taxation
Corporate income tax expense represents the sum of the current corporate income tax expense and deferred
tax.
The current corporate income tax expense is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from
profit before tax as reported in the statement of profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense
that are taxable or deductible in other years (including loss carried forward, if any) and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized
for all taxable temporary differences, unless they occurred from the initial recognition of an asset or liability
of a transaction which has no impact on accounting profit or taxable profit/(loss) at the transaction date.
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled
or the asset is realized. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority
and the Bank intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The determination of the current corporate income tax expense is based on the current interpretation of tax
regulations. However, these regulations are subject to periodic variation and their ultimate determination
depends on the results of the tax authorities’ examinations.
Other taxes are paid in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in Vietnam.
Employee benefits
Post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefits are paid to retired employees of the Bank by the Social Insurance Agency, under

dated 12 March 2015 regulating the implementation of the Employment Law’s provision on unemployment
insurance, from 01 January 2009, the Bank is obliged to pay unemployment insurance for eligible

45. RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES RELATED TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Bank's Board of Directors has a shared responsibility for establishing and overseeing the Bank's risk
management framework. The Bank's Board of Directors has established a Risk Management Committee
responsible for developing and overseeing the Bank's risk management policies in each management area.
42PROSPERITY AND GROWTH COMMERCIAL JOINT STOCK BANK
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Form: B05/TCTD
For the period from January 1, 2025 to June 30, 2025 Unit: VND million
All boards of the Board of Directors have dedicated and non-specialized members and periodically report
to the Board of Directors on their activities.
The Bank's risk policy is established to identify and analyze the risks exposed by the Bank, to establish
appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adhere to limits. Risk management policies
and systems are regularly reviewed to reflect changes in market conditions, products and services provided
by the Bank. Through training activities and standards and management systems, the Bank aims to develop
a disciplined and positive control environment in which all its employees understand their roles and
obligations.
The Bank's Internal Audit Department conducts periodic and unscheduled reviews of risk management
control systems and procedures and reports the results of the review to the Board of Directors.
In addition to establishing risk management departments and policies related to financial instruments, the
Bank also coordinates with partners in the field of information technology and telecommunications to
support risk management by building an integrated system of risk management tools to protect customers,
supplier and enhance the sustainable development of the Bank.
46. CURRENCY RISK
Currency risk is the risk that the Bank’s asset or value of an investment fluctuates due to changes in foreign
exchange rates. The Bank was established and operates in Vietnam with reporting currency of VND. The
Bank’s assets are denominated mainly in VND and partly in other currencies. The Bank has launched a
limit system to manage foreign exchange risks deriving from foreign exchange position held by the Bank.
Foreign exchange positions are monitored on a daily basis and hedging strategies are used to ensure that
risk management indicators are maintained within the established limits.
47. INTEREST RATE RISK
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Bank must bear when the fluctuation of interest rate adversely influences
the Bank’s income, the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet commitments. The repricing term
is the remaining term from the date of the financial statements to the latest repricing date of interest rate
sensitive assets and liabilities. The following assumptions and conditions are applied when analyzing the
interest rate repricing term of the Banks’ assets and liabilities:
► Cash, gold and gemstones; long-term investments; fixed assets; other assets and other liabilities are
classified as items which are free of interest rate sensitivity;
► Balances with the SBV are classified as interest-free for the non-compulsory reserve of VND and
compulsory reserve of USD; the remaining balance is classified into a term of up to one month;
► Trading securities: The repricing term of trading securities is determined based on information about
the actual maturity date or remaining holding period as prescribed and the latest repricing date of the
securities (for floating rate securities) from the date of the financial statements, whichever is earlier.

determined based on the actual maturity date or the latest re-pricing date (for floating-rate items)
calculated from the date of the financial statements, whichever is earlier.
