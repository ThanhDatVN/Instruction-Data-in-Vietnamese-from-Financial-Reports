income tax 163.41%Reasons: In Quarter 11/2025 profit after corporate income tax increase compared
to Quarter 11/2024 mainly due to the following reasons:
- Financial income increased 248.17% compared to the same period last year, the
increase was due to higher dividends received from financial investment activities.
- Financial Expense decreased 317.93% compared to the same period last year
due to financial investments in efficiently performing entities - Reversal of provision
for non-current financial investments.
- Selling Expense decreased 100.00% compared to the same period last year due
to brokerage commission expenses did not incurred during the period.
This led to a 147.26% increase in total accounting profit before tax, resulting in
a 163.41% increase in profit after corporate income tax compared to the same period
last year.
Sonadezi Corporation provides an explanation to the State Securities
Commission, the Hanoi Stock Exchange and shareholders for information.
