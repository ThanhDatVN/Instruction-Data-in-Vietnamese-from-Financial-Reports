INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To: Shareholders
The Board of Directors and Board of Management
Vietnam National Aviation Insurance Corporation
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Vietnam National Aviation Insurance Corporation (the
"Corporation"), prepared on 27 March 2025 as set out from page 05 to page 44, which comprise the balance sheet
as at 31 December 2024, and the statement of income and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Board of Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The Board of Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with Vietnamese accounting standards, accounting regime applicable to insurance enterprises and
legal regulations relating to financial reporting, and for such internal control as the Board of Management
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors' Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the finapcial
' II
statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the Corporation's preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal
control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates made by the Board of Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.

accounting policies (if any) and relevant information obtained by the Corporation as at the reporting
date.
• The fair value of deposits at domestic commercial joint stock banks is determined by book value due to

accounting periods, including prepayments for insurance commission, unallocated insurance acquisition
expenses, office repair and renovation expenses, tools and supplies issued for consumption and other
prepayments.
Unallocated commission and insurance acquisition expenses of insurance operations are allocated

During the year, the Corporation revised its accounting estimates. Specifically, it adjusted the allocation
of customer assessment and evaluation expenses directly related to insurance underwriting activities to
align with the actual annual insurance premium revenue derived from these assessment services.

estimates has impacted certain financial statement indicators compared to previous years, as outlined

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FORM B09-DNPNT
a) Non-life insurance lines
Unearned premium reserve
Unearned premium reserves are made by a factor of period of direct policies, in which:
For insurance and reinsurance contracts with a term of 01 year or less, premium reserves are made
at a percentage of the total retained insurance premium, specifically as follows:
• For cargo insurance, the unearned premium reserves are made at 25% of the total direct written
premium, inward reinsurance and outward reinsurance; and
• For other insurance operations: unearned premium reserves are made at 50% of the total direct
written premium, inward reinsurance and outward reinsurance.
For insurance and reinsurance contracts with a term of more than 01 year, unearned premium
reserves are made in line with the method of making unearned premium reserve on a daily basis.
Claim reserve: For losses incurred and reported, the Corporation provides for claim reserves for direct
insurance and inward reinsurance and outward reinsurance using the statistic of retention liabilities for
each estimated loss incurred and reported.
For incurred but not reported ("IBNR") losses, the claims reserve is established based on statistical loss
ratios over the past three consecutive years. The Board of Management believes IBNR reserve has been
prudently evaluated and fully recorded.
Catastrophe reserve: Under Vietnamese Accounting Standard No. 19 "Insurance Contract", provision for
the possible claims under contracts that are not incurred or do not exist at the reporting date (including
catastrophe reserve) are not necessary. However, the Corporation follows the reserve policy in
accordance with Circular 67, accordingly catastrophe reserve for all types of Insurance services were
consistently made at 1% of total retained premium in the year.
b) Health insurance lines
Mathematical reserve
For health insurance and reinsurance policies (insurance contracts) in case of death or permanent
disability, mathematical reserves are made according to the net premium method on the basis of gross
insurance premium.
For others health insurance and reinsurance contracts (insurance contracts) with term of more than 1
year, mathematical reserves are made according to the coefficient of the insurance policy term on a daily
basis on the basis of gross insurance premium.
Unearned premium reserve
For health insurance and reinsurance contracts (insurance contracts) with a term of less than 1 year, the
reserves are made at 50% of the total direct written premium, inward reinsurance and outward
reinsurance.

Claim reserve: For losses incurred and reported, the Corporation provides for claim reserves for direct
insurance and inward reinsurance and outward reinsurance using the statistic of retention liabilities for
each estimated loss incurred and reported.
For losses incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), the claims reserve is established based on statistical loss
ratios over the past three consecutive years. The Board of Management believes IBNR reserve has been
prudently evaluated and fully recorded.
Effective from 01 January 2024, the Corporation changed its method for provisioning claims reserves for
incurred but not reported (IBNR) losses. The previous approach, which applied a 3% premium-based
provision for each insurance line, has been replaced with a provisioning method based on statistical loss
ratios over the past three consecutive years. As a result, this change in provisioning methodology has
impacted certain financial statement indicators, as detailed below:
Items lncrease/(decrease)

premium retained in the year and recorded in Catastrophe reserve in the balance sheet.
Reserves for the Corporation's direct insurance and inward reinsurance are not offset with reserve for -<
outward reinsurance. Such reserves should be presented under separate items in the balance sheet.
Accordingly, unearned premium reserve and claim reserve for direct insurance and inward reinsurance
and catastrophe reserve are recognized as payables while unearned premium reserve for outward IE
reinsurance and claim reserve for outward reinsurance are recognized as reinsurance assets.
Insurance deposits
The Corporation is obliged to pay a deposit equal to 2% of the legal capital, the deposit shall receive
interest in accordance with the agreement reached with the bank into which it is paid and the

solvency is inadequate and upon written approval of the Ministry of Finance.
Enterprise funds

equal to 10% of the Corporation's charter capital.
Unearned revenue

accounting periods for commission income from outward reinsurance and interest income that have
been yet earned. The Company recognizes unearned revenue in proportion to its obligations that the
Company will have to perform in the future. When the revenue recognition conditions are satisfied,
unearned revenue will be recognized in the income statement for the year corresponding to the portion

19VIETNAM NATIONAL AVIATION INSURANCE CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FORM B09-DNPNT

allocate to the subsequent financial years in accordance with the above-mentioned method.
Other income from reinsurance activities is recognized when incurred.
Other revenue
Interest income from deposits and bonds is accrued on accrual basis, by reference to the principal
outstanding and at the applicable interest rate.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Corporation's right to receive payment has

Claim settlement expenses for inward reinsurance are recorded as incurred following the statement of
accounts sent by the reinsurers to the Corporation and the claim is accepted by the Corporation.
Claim receipts from ceded policies are recognized based on the receivable amount incurred
corresponding to the claim settlement expenses recorded in the year and the ceded ratios.
Commission expenses for direct insurance and inward reinsurance are recognized corresponding to direct ^
premium and inward reinsurance premium incurred in the year. In the year, the entire commission
expenses for direct insurance and inward reinsurance under inward reinsurance contracts signed in
accordance with regulations of the financial regime are presented in the items "Commission expenses for E J
direct insurance" and "Commission expenses for inward reinsurance".
At the year end, the Corporation should determine unearned commission expenses for direct insurance
and inward reinsurance which have not been recognized as expenses for the year corresponding to
unearned direct premium and inward reinsurance premium so as to allocate such commission expenses
to the subsequent financial years in accordance with the above-mentioned method.
Commission expenses and operating expenses corresponding to unearned revenue are recorded by the
Corporation as prepaid expenses and are reflected as "Long-term prepaid expenses" on the Financial
Statements. These commission and operating expenses will be recorded as incurred expenses
corresponding to the unrealized revenue from previous years recorded on the current year.

proportion to premium income. The unallocated sales support expenses will be recognized as a prepaid
expense and be allocated to insurance business expenses for the following years.

20VIETNAM NATIONAL AVIATION INSURANCE CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FORM B09-DNPNT
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before
tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable
or deductible in other years (including loss carried forward, if any) and it further excludes items that are
never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is recognized on significant differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is
accounted for using balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is
settled, or the asset is realized. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax
authority and the Corporation intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The determination of the tax currently payable is based on the current interpretation of tax regulations.
However, these regulations are subject to periodic variation and their ultimate determination depends
on the results of the tax authorities' examinations. <
Other taxes are paid in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in Vietnam. x

The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is stated at the value of convertible financial
instruments in a current transaction between the parties, except where required to sell or liquidation.
The Corporation uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value:
- The fair value of investments is determined as presented in Note 5.
- The fair value of short-term items including cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables, other receivables,
loans, trade payables, accrued expenses, and other short-term amounts is equivalent to the book value of
these items due to their short or undetermined terms.
- For financial assets and financial liabilities with insufficient information in the market to determine the
fair value at the reporting date, the book value of these items is shown instead of the fair value.
Financial risk management objectives
The Corporation has set up risk management system to identify and assess the risks exposed by the
Corporation and designed control policies and procedures to manage those risks at an acceptable level.
Risk management system is reviewed on a regular basis to reflect changes in market conditions and the
Corporation's operations.
Financial risks include market risk (including foreign currency risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk
and insurance risk.
Market risk
The Corporation's activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and prices. The Corporation does not hedge these risk exposures due to the lack of active
market for the trading activities of financial instruments.
37VIETNAM NATIONAL AVIATION INSURANCE CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FORM B09-DNPNT
Share price risk management
Shares held by the Corporation are affected by market risks arising from the uncertainty about future
prices of such shares. The Corporation manages this risk exposure by setting up investment limits. The
Corporation's Board of Directors also assesses and approves decisions on share investments such as
operating industry, investees, etc. The Corporation assesses the share price risk to be immaterial.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in
financial loss to the Corporation. The Corporation has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit
risk is monitored on an on-going basis. The Corporation does not have any significant credit risk exposure
to any counterparty because receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse
industries and geographical areas.
Liquidity risk management
The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure the availability of funds to meet present and
future financial obligations. Liquidity is also managed by ensuring that the excess of maturing liabilities
over maturing assets in any year is kept to manageable levels relative to the amount of funds that the
Corporation believes can generate within that year. The Corporation's policy is to regularly monitor
current and expected liquidity requirements to ensure that the Corporation maintains sufficient reserves
of cash and adequate committed funding from its owner to meet its liquidity requirements in the short
and longer terms.
The following table details the Corporation's remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative
financial assets and financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The table has been drawn up
based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial assets and undiscounted cash flows of financial
liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Corporation can be required to pay. The inclusion of
information on non-derivative financial assets is necessary in order to understand the Corporation's
liquidity risk management as the liquidity is managed on a net asset and liability basis.

The Board of Management assessed the liquidity risk at low level. The Board of Management believes
that the Corporation will be able to generate sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations as and
when they fall due.
Insurance risk
A risk arising from any insurance contract is the possibility that the insured event occurs and the
uncertainty of the amount of the claims payments. As the nature of an insurance contract, this risk is
random and therefore unpredictable.
To achieve the goal of managing insurance risk, the Corporation has established and applied a full range
of risk assessment processes before accepting insurance, insurance risk transfer processes (reinsurance),
damage assessment processes and claim settlement processes.
For premium operations, the Corporation has diversified the types of insurance services, insurance
products as well as geographical areas to minimize concentrations of insurance risk. Besides, the
Corporation has also applied different criteria in risk selection, implemented various measures in risk
assessment to build an appropriate premium level. The Corporation does not accept insurance risks that
highly likely occur or are subject to self-interested profit-maximizing behaviours.
For insurance risks accepted for the year ended 31 December 2024, the Corporation redefined the
premium rates applicable to each risk group based on historical loss statistics and forecast the trend of
risks, inflation, level of industry competition and related regulations.
• With regard to the risk groups having increasing rates of losses and premiums, the Corporation
will only accept insurance risk if the insured accepts to increase the premium correspondingly or
limit the insurance coverage and increase deductibles;
• With regard to the risk groups having loss rate increasing but still at an acceptable level and
ensuring insurance profit, the Corporation has adopted a policy on increasing the proportion of
acceptable insurance risk to have its market share risen, and also takes advantage of cash inflows
from insurance premiums for the purpose of investments.
39VIETNAM NATIONAL AVIATION INSURANCE CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) FORM B09-DNPNT
The Corporation has also conducted thorough and strict measures to transfer insurance risks to other
insurance companies in order to minimize the risks which may occur but still ensure the effectiveness of
insurance businesses through building a reasonable level of retained premium for each type of insurance
products, reinsurance arrangements and co-insurances.
The Corporation has been undertaking the policy on the acceleration of the damage assessment and
settlement of compensation to minimize the risks which may arise during the compensation assessment
process, such as exchange rate risk, inflation risk, increased loss risk, ethical risk, etc. The damage
assessment and compensation settlement are conducted by the Corporation at two different levels
depending on the complexity and nature of damage:
• For large and complicated cases, the damage assessment and compensation settlement will be
conducted at the Corporation's office;
• For small motor vehicle insurance cases in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City shall be processed by the
Northern and Southern Regional Customer Care and Motor Vehicle Assessment Representative
Offices. For small motor vehicle claims in other regions, as well as other types of insurance
claims where member companies possess adequate experience and resources, the respective
member companies shall be responsible for processing such claims.
