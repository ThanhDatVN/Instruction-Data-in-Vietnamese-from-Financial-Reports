The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements consolidated financial
statements of Vietnam Industrial Construction Joint Stock Corporation and the financial
statements of the companies controlled by the Corporation (its subsidiaries) prepared for the

since the date of the combination. Losses incurred in a subsidiary must be allocated to the non­
controlling interest, even if the loss is greater than the non-controlling interest in the net assets of
the subsidiary.
Business combination
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at
the date of acquisition. Any additional difference between the purchase price and the fair value of
the assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any negative difference between the purchase price
and the fair value of the assets acquired is recognised in the income statement for the year in which
the subsidiary is acquired.
Non-controlling interests at the date of the initial business combination are measured based on the
non-controlling interest's share of the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
recognised.

Standards, Enterprise Accounting Regime and legal regulations related to the preparation and

• Other payables reflect non-commercial payables not related to the purchase, sale or provision of
goods and services.
Provisions for payables
Provisions are recognised when the Coiporation has a present obligation as a result of a past event,

measured based on management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation
at the balance sheet date.

shareholders.
Profit Distribution
Profit after corporate income tax is distributed to shareholders after setting aside funds according
to the Corporation's Charter as well as legal regulations and approved by the General Meeting of
Shareholders.
The distribution of profits to shareholders takes into account non-monetary items in undistributed
profits after tax that may affect cash flow and the ability to pay dividends/profits such as gains
from revaluation of contributed assets, gains from revaluation of monetary items, financial
instruments and other non-monetary items.
Dividends are recognized as liabilities when approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.

the products or goods;
(b) The Corporation no longer holds the right to manage the goods as the owner of the goods or
the right to control the goods;

portion of work completed at the reporting date . The outcome of a transaction involving the
rendering of services is recognized when all four (4) of the following conditions are satisfied:

Ba Dinh District, Hanoi City December 22, 2014 of the Ministry of Finance
(c) Determine the portion of work completed at the reporting date ; and
(d) Identify the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction to

(b) Revenue is determined with relative certainty.
Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis, based on the outstanding balances and the
applicable-interest rate.
Construction contract
When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the end of the
reporting period, measured as a proportion of the estimated total contract costs incuiTed for work
performed to date, except where this proportion is not representative of the stage of completion.
This may include additional costs , compensation and performance bonuses as agreed with the
customer.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised
only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable.

Balances of foreign currency items at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate on
that date. Exchange differences arising are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income .
Exchange gains resulting from revaluation of balances at the balance sheet date are not distributed
to shareholders.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognized as production and business expenses in the year when incurred,
unless capitalized in accordance with the provisions of the Accounting Standard "Borrowing
costs". Accordingly, borrowing costs directly related to the purchase, construction or production of
assets that necessarily take a relatively long time to complete and put into use or business are
added to the original cost of the asset until such time as the asset is put into use or business.
Income arising from temporary investment of loans is recorded as a reduction in the original cost
of the related assets. For separate loans for the construction of fixed assets, investment real estate,
interest is capitalized even when the construction period is less than 12 months.
ent real estate, interest is capitalized even when the construction period is less than 12 months,
erest is capitalized even when the construction period is less than 12 months.
Tax
Corporate income tax represents the sum of cun'ent and deferred tax liabilities. The tax currently
payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in
the consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable
or deductible in other years (including losses carried forward, if any) and it further excludes items
that are not taxable or deductible.
Deferred income tax is calculated on the differences between the carrying amount and the tax base
of assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and is recorded under the balance
sheet method. Deferred income tax liabilities should be recognized for all temporary differences
while deferred income tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that future taxable profits
will be available against which the temporary differences can be used.

JOINT -STOCK CORPORATION
Vinaincon Building, No. 5 Lang Ha, Thanh Cong Ward Issued under Circular No. 202/2014/TT-BTC
Ba Dinh District, Hanoi City December 22, 2014 of the Ministry of Finance
Deferred income tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the
asset is realised or the liability is settled. Deferred income tax is recognised in the consolidated
income statement and is denominated in equity except when it relates to items charged or credited
directly to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the
same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net
basis.
The determination of the Corporation's income tax is based on current tax regulations. However,
these regulations are subject to change from time to time and the final determination of coi-porate
income tax depends on the results of the examination by the competent tax authority.
Other taxes are applied according to current tax laws in Vietnam.

significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are
also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant
influence.

relationship than to the legal form.
