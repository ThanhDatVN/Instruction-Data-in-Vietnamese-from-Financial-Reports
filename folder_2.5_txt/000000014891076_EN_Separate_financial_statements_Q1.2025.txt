16 . Principles of recording convertible bonds
Convertible bonds are bonds that can be converted into common shares of the same issuing organization under the x
conditions specified in the issuance plan. ^
Convertible bonds are tracked by type, maturity, interest rate and face value.
When issuing convertible bonds, the principal portion of the convertible bonds is recorded as liabilities; the equity
component (stock options) of the convertible bonds is recorded as equity. ^ I
At the time of initial recognition, the cost of issuing convertible bonds is recorded as a reduction of the principal of the \
bond. Periodically, the cost of issuing convertible bonds is gradually allocated in accordance with the bond term using ^
the straight-line method or the effective interest rate method by recording an increase in the principal value and
recording it in financial expenses or capitalizing it in accordance with the recognition of the interest payable on the
bond; the interest on the bond is recorded in financial expenses.

equity portion is transferred to be recorded as equity surplus regardless of whether the bondholder exercises the option
to convert the bond into shares or not. The principal of the convertible bond is recorded as a decrease corresponding to
the amount of bond repayment in case the bondholder does not exercise the option to convert the bond into shares or an
increase in equity corresponding to the par value of the additional shares issued in case the bondholder exercises the
option to convert the bond into shares, the difference between the principal value of the convertible bond greater than
the value of the additional shares issued at par value is recorded as equity surplus.
17 . Principle of equity recognition
- Principles for recording owners' capital contributions, share premiums, convertible bond options, and other owners'
capital
Owner's capital is recorded according to the actual capital contributed by the owner and is tracked in detail for each
organization and individual contributing capital.
When the investment license stipulates that the company's charter capital is determined in foreign currency, the
determination of the investor's capital contribution in foreign currency is based on the amount of foreign currency
actually contributed.
Capital contribution in the form of assets is recorded as an increase in equity according to the revaluation value of the
assets accepted by the capital contributors. For intangible assets such as brands, trademarks, trade names, exploitation
rights, project development rights, etc., capital contribution can only be increased if permitted by relevant laws.
For joint stock companies, shareholders' equity is recorded at the actual price of shares issued, but is reflected in two
separate indicators:
- Owners' equity is recorded at the par value of the shares;
- Share premium is recorded at the larger or smaller difference between the actual price of shares issued and the par
value.
In addition, capital surplus is also recorded as the larger or smaller difference between the actual issue price and the par
value of shares when reissuing treasury shares.
The option to convert a bond issued with shares arises when a company issues a type of bond that can be converted into
a specified number of shares as specified in the issuance plan. The value of the equity component of a convertible bond
is the difference between the total amount received from the issuance of the convertible bond and the value of the debt
component of the convertible bond. At the time of initial recognition, the value of the stock option of a convertible
bond is recorded separately in the owner's equity. When the bond matures, the option is accounted for as equity surplus.
Other capital reflects business capital formed by supplementing business results or by being donated, presented,
sponsored, or revaluation of assets (according to current regulations).V1ETOURIST HOLDINGS .JOINT STOCK COMPANY

term payables is equivalent to the book value (net of provisions for the estimated uncollectible portion) of these items due to their short maturity..
- The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets listed on the stock market is the published trading price at the end of the accounting period. The Company has not yet
performed a formal valuation of unlisted available-for-sale financial assets.. However, the Board Board of Directors The fair value of these financial assets is not
materially different from their carrying value..

a financial loss to the Company. ^

(bank deposits and other financial instruments).
- Accounts receivable
The Company minimizes credit risk by only dealing with financially sound entities and by having its accounts x
receivable staff regularly monitor receivables to expedite collection. On this basis, and since the Company's receivables 1\
are related to many different customers, the concentration of credit risk in customer receivables is low.
- Bank deposit
The majority of the Company's bank deposits are held at large, reputable banks in Vietnam. The Company considers the
concentration of credit risk in bank deposits to be low.
b. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will have difficulty fulfilling its financial obligations due to lack of capital.
Board of Directors ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management. The Company's liquidity risk arises mainly
from the fact that financial assets and financial liabilities have different maturities.
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining an appropriate level of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings
at levels deemed appropriate by the Board. Board of Directors deemed sufficient to meet the Company's operating needs
in order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in cash flows.
