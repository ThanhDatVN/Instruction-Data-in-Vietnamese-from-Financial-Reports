REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
To: The Shareholders
The Board of Directors and Management
Phu My Water Supply Joint Stock Company
We have reviewed the accompanying interim financial statements of Phu My Water Supply Joint Stock
Company (the “Company’’), prepared on 4 August 2025, as set out from page 5 to page 29, which comprise
the interim balance sheet as at 30 June 2025, the interim statement of income, the interim statement of cash
flows for the 6-month period then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information.
Management’s Responsibility for the interim financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these interim financial statements in
accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, accounting regime for enterprises and legal regulations
relating to interim financial reporting and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to
enable the preparation of interim financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the accompanying interim financial statements based on our
review. We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review Engagements (VSRE) *
2410 - Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity.
A review of interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of person responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of significant matters
that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
interim financial statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
I
Company as at 30 June 2025, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the 6-month period then

standards of the Ministry of Finance in the preparation and presentation of interim financial statements.
IV. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies, which have been adopted by the Company in the preparation of
these interim financial statements, are as follows:
Estimates
The preparation of interim financial statements in conformity with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, H
accounting regime for enterprises and legal regulations relating to interim financial reporting requires Ĩ0/
Board of Directors and Board of Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the ' 1
reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the interim financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.
Although these accounting estimates are based on the Board of Management's best knowledge, actual
results may differ from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial investments
Held-to-maturity investments Vq\
Held-to-maturity investments comprise investments that the Company has the positive intent or ability
to hold to maturity, including term deposits (commercial bills), bonds, preference shares which the /&
issuer shall redeem at a certain date in the future, loans held to maturity to earn periodic interest and
other held-to-maturity investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are recognised on a trade date basis and are initially measured at
acquisition price plus directly attributable transaction costs. Post-acquisition interest income from held-
to-maturity investments is recognised in the income statement on accrual basis. Pre-acquisition
interest is deducted from the cost of such investments at the acquisition date.
When there is solid evidence that part or all of the investment may not be recoverable and the amount
of loss can be reliably determined, the loss is recorded in financial expenses during the year and
reduced direct deduction of investment value.
Held-to-maturity investments are measured at cost less provision for doubtful debts.
Provision for doubtful debts relating to held-to-maturity investments is made in accordance with
prevailing accounting regulations.

IV. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a
subsidiary nor an interest in joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not control or joint control over those
policies.
Interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost. The Company’s
share of the net profit of the investee after acquisition is recognised in the income statement. Other
distributions received other than such profit share are deducted from the cost of the investments as
recoverable amounts.
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost less
provision for impairment of such investments (if any).
Provisions for impairment of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates are made when
the subsidiaries, joint ventures, or associates suffer losses at a level equal to the difference between
the actual contributed capital of the parties at subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates and the
actual equity multiplied by the Company's capital contribution ratio compared to the total actual capital
contribution of the parties at the subsidiaries and affiliates joint venture, association. If a subsidiary,
joint venture or associate company is the subject of a consolidated financial statement, the basis for
determining loss provisions is the consolidated financial statement.
Increases and decreases in provisions for investment losses in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and
associates need to be appropriated at the end of the fiscal year and are recorded in financial expenses
Receivables
Receivables represent the amounts recoverable from customers or other debtors and are stated at
book value less provision for doubtful debts.
Provision for doubtful receivables is made for each receivable based on the overdue period of principal
repayment in accordance with the original debt agreement (excluding any extensions agreed upon
between parties) or based on the estimated potential loss as assessed by the Company. The
difference between the provision to be made at the end of the current fiscal year and the provision
already recorded at the end of the prior fiscal year is recognized as an increase or decrease in general
and administrative expenses during the fiscal year. Receivables determined to be uncollectible are
written off.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and
where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the
inventories to their present location and condition. Inventory value is determined according to the
weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all
estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The evaluation of necessary provision for inventory obsolescence follows current prevailing accounting
regulations which allow provisions to be made for obsolete, damaged, or sub-standard inventories and
for those which have costs higher than net realisable values as at the balance sheet date.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The costs of purchased tangible fixed assets comprise their purchase prices and any directly
attributable costs of bringing the assets to their working condition and location for their intended use.

These notes are an integral part of and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying interim financial statement
IV. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation (Continued)
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives
as follows:
Years
Buildings and structures 06-25
Machinery, equipment 06-15
Vehicles, transportation equipment 08-25
Office equipment and furniture 03-10
Loss or gain resulting from sales and disposals of tangible fixed assets is the difference between profit
from sales or disposals of assets and their residual values and is recognised in the income statement.
Fixed assets of finance leasing
A lease is considered a financial lease when most of the rights and risks of asset ownership are
transferred to the lessee. All other leases are considered operating leases.
A lease is considered an operating lease when the lessor still enjoys the majority of the benefits and
must bear the risks of ownership of the asset. Operating lease costs are recorded in the Income
Statement on a straight-line basis throughout the lease term. Amounts received or receivable to yz
facilitate the conclusion of operating leases are also recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease
term.
Intangible fixed assets and amortisation
The Company's intangible fixed assets are land use rights and accounting software.
Intangible fixed assets represent the value of land use rights and are presented at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Land use rights are allocated using the straight-line method based on the
granted period of use within 15 years.
Intangible fixed assets are recorded at their original cost, reflected on the Balance Sheet according to ^
the criteria of original price, accumulated depreciation and residual value. qq
Costs related to computer software programs that are not an integral part of the related hardware are
capitalized. The original price of computer software is all expenses that the Company has spent up to 'AF
the time the software is put into use. Computer software is amortized using the straight-line method >H
from 3 to 8 years. .
Construction in progress
Properties in the course of construction for production, rental and administrative purposes or for other
purposes are carried at cost. The cost includes any costs that are necessary to form the asset
including construction cost, equipment cost, other directly attributable costs in accordance with the
Company’s accounting policy. Such costs will be included in the estimated costs of the fixed assets (if
settled costs have not been approved) when they are put into use.
Prepayments
Prepaid expenses include actual expenses that have been incurred but are related to the results of
production and business activities of many accounting periods. Prepaid expenses include the value of
tools, instruments, small components issued for use, other repair costs and are considered to have the
potential to bring future economic benefits to the Company. These costs are capitalized in the form of
prepayments and allocated to the Income Statement, using the straight-line method in accordance with
current accounting regulations.

Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all five (5) following conditions are satisfied:
(a) The Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the
goods;
(b) The Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;
(c) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; When the contract stipulates that the buyer is
entitled to return the products or goods, purchased under specific conditions, revenue is
recognized only when those specific conditions no longer exist and the buyer is not entitled to pay
return products and goods (except for cases where customers have the right to return goods in
the form of exchange for other goods or services);
(d) The Company has obtained or will receive economic benefits from the sale transaction; and
(e) The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Revenue of a transaction involving the rendering of services is recognised when the outcome of such
transactions can be measured reliably. Where a transaction involving the rendering of services is
attributable to several periods, revenue is recognised in each period by reference to the percentage of
completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date of that period. The outcome of a transaction
can be measured reliably when all four (4) following conditions are satisfied:
(a) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably; When the contract stipulates that the buyer is
entitled to return the products or goods, purchased under specific conditions, revenue is
recognized only when those specific conditions no longer exist and the buyer is not entitled to pay
return products and goods;
(b) It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company;
(c) The percentage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date can be measured
reliably; and
(d) The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured
reliably.
Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis, determined on the balance of the deposit account
and the interest rate applied.
Interest from investments is recognized when the Company has the right to receive the profit. -
IC
Dividends and profits are distributed
Dividends and distributed profits are recognized when the Company is entitled to receive dividends or
profits from capital contribution. Dividends received in shares are only tracked by the number of
additional shares, the value of shares received is not recorded/recorded at par value.
\j
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the year when incurred unless they are
capitalised in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standard “Borrowing costs”. Accordingly,
borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets,
which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or
sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for
their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific
borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the cost of those assets.
For specific borrowings for the purpose of construction of fixed assets and investment properties,
borrowing costs are capitalised even when the construction period is under 12 months.

IV. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Borrowing costs (Continued)
For general loans that are used for construction investment purposes or production of unfinished
assets, the capitalized borrowing costs are determined according to the capitalization rate for the
average cumulative cost, rights arising for investment in capital construction or production of that
asset. The capitalization rate is calculated according to the weighted average interest rate of
outstanding loans during the year, except for separate loans serving the purpose of creating a specific
asset.
Tax
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before
tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are
taxable or deductible in other years (including loss carried forward, if any) and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible.
The Company has determined that it meets the type, criteria, scale, and standards applicable to
establishments operating in the socialized environmental sector, in accordance with Prime Minister's
Decision No. 1466/QD-TTg and Decision No. 693/QD-TTg. Accordingly, the portion of the Company's
income derived from socialized activities in the clean water supply sector is subject to a preferential
corporate income tax rate of 10% throughout its operating period.
Deferred tax is recognised on significant differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit
and are accounted for using balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally
recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilized.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is
settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates
to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The determination of the tax currently payable is based on the current interpretation of tax regulations.
However, these regulations are subject to periodic variation and their ultimate determination depends
on the results of the tax authorities’ examinations.
Other taxes are paid in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in Vietnam.
Basic/diluted earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the after-tax profit or loss allocated to shareholders
owning the Company's common shares (after adjusting for appropriations for bonus and welfare funds)
by the amount weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the after-tax profit (or loss) allocated to
shareholders owning the Company's common shares (after adjusting for dividends on preferred shares
with convertible rights) exchange for the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the year and the weighted average number of common shares that would be issued in the event
that all potential common shares are issued. All declines are converted into common shares.

(*) The Company has not determined the fair value of the financial investments at the end of the accounting period for disclosure in the interim financial statements
because there is no listed market price for the financial investments and the current Accounting Standards and Accounting Regime for Vietnamese enterprises do not
have specific guidance on determining the fair value of financial investments. The fair value of these financial investments may differ from their carrying value.
