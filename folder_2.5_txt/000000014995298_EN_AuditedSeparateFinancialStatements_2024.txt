INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
To: The Shareholders, the Board of Directors and the Board of General Directors
The Golden Group Joint Stock Company
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of The Golden Group Joint Stock
Company ("the Company”), prepared on 19 May 2025, as set out from page 8 to 36, which
comprise the Balance sheet as at 31 December 2024, the Income statement, the Cash flow
statement for the fiscal year then ended and the Notes to the Financial statements.
The Board of General Directors’ responsibility
The Board of General Directors of the Company is responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of these financial statements of the Company in accordance with the Vietnamese
Accounting Standards, Vietnamese Accounting System and comply with relevant statutory
requirements to preparation and presentation of the financial statements and for such internal
control as the Board of General Directors of the Company determines is necessary to enable the
preparation and presentation of these financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on Auditing. Those standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An auditor involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers
internal control relevant to the Company’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. An
audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of General Directors, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our qualified audit opinion.
Basis for Qualified Opinion

certain items presented in the Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.
o

2. As disclosed in point (d) of section 5.2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, as at December
31, 2024, the Company had not yet considered the impact of the qualified opinion stated in the
audit report of the 2024 financial statements of Louis AMC Asset Management and Exploitation
Joint Stock Company (hereinafter referred to as “Louis AMC”) as a basis for assessing the
financial position and recoverability of the investment in Louis AMC, which has a historical cost of
VND 88,700,000,000.
In the 2024 audited financial statements of Louis AMC, the auditor issued a qualified opinion due
to the lack of sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the provision for impairment of
other long-term investment by Louis AMC in Louis Rice Import and Export Joint Stock Company.
The original investment value as at 31 December 2024 was VND 9,795,414,653, and the provision
recognized was VND 9,795,414,653 (as at December 31, 2023: VND 6,621,315,939). In addition,
the auditor of Louis AMC also issued a qualified opinion on the inability to obtain sufficient and
appropriate audit evidence to assess and make necessary adjustments to the balance of
inventories held by other companies on behalf of Louis AMC as at 31 December 2024, amounting
to VND 12,272,727,273.
Accordingly, we were also unable to determine the impact of these qualified matters on the
potential additional impairment provision (if any) required as at 31 December 2024, as well as their
effects on other related items in the accompanying financial statements.
Qualified Opinion
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the "Basis for Qualified Opinion”
section, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of, in all material respects,
the financial position of The Golden Group Joint Stock Company as at 31 December 2024 and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal year then ended in accordance with the
Vietnamese Accounting Standards and Vietnamese Accounting System and comply with relevant
statutory requirements to preparation and presentation of the financial statements.
Emphasis of Matter
Without qualifying our opinion above, we draw attention to the following matters:
1. As disclosed in section 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, pursuant to Notice No.
5507/TB-SGDHN dated December 22, 2023, issued by the Hanoi Stock Exchange, the
Company's shares commenced trading on the Unlisted Public Company Market (UPCoM) at
the Hanoi Stock Exchange starting from December 29, 2023. Prior to this, the Company's

Emphasis of Matter (cont.)
2. As disclosed in Note 5.2 to the financial statements:
- As at December 31, 2024, the Company completed the divestment by selling all of its

was 51.00%, and as a result, Golden Paddy Joint Stock Company was considered a subsidiary.
- As at December 31, 2024, the Company had completed the sale of its entire capital contribution
in PBP Purchasing By Products One Member Co., Ltd., with value of VND 5,000,000,000 (paid-
in capital of VND 1,850,000,000), according to the Capital Transfer Agreement dated August 9,

- As of December 31, 2024, the Company has completed the sale of all 755,000 shares at HB

dated December 1, 2024, to Mr. Bui Ngoc My at a transfer price of VND 10,000/share.
Previously, the Company received the transfer of 255,000 shares, equivalent to the ownership
ratio of 51.00% and voting rights ratio of 51.00% from individual Shareholders under the Share
Transfer Contract dated April 21, 2023. At the same time, according to the Board of Directors
Resolution No. 06/2024/TGG/HDQT-NQ dated May 23, 2024 of the Company and the Minutes
of confirmation of the conversion of the loan into capital contribution between the Company and
HB Pharma Joint Stock Company, the Company has increased the number of shares owned to
755,000 shares, equivalent to the ownership ratio and voting rights ratio of 75.50% and
75.50%, respectively. As of the issuance date of this report, the Company has not yet collected
this transfer amount.
3. As disclosed in point (g) of section 5.2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, as at
December 31, 2024, the Company had invested in Construction and Investment Consulting
Joint Stock Company (an associate) (hereinafter referred to as “CIC”) at an original cost of VND

statements, CIC recorded a provision for impairment of long-term investment in Pomax
Corporation with an amount of VND 18,099,838 against an original investment of VND A
56,925,000,000. As at December 31, 2023, the auditor of this associate expressed a qualified S
opinion on its financial statements due to the lack of sufficient and appropriate audit evidence ^ I
regarding the necessity and amount of the provision for impairment of long-term investment.
4. As disclosed in section 5.13.2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, the balance of other
payables to individuals related to the business cooperation contracts of the Ao Gioi - Suoi Tien /
Resort Project as at December 31, 2024 was VND 0 (as at December 31, 2023: VND /i
3,080,000,000). These business cooperation contracts did not specify the method of profit c
distribution, distribution ratio, total capital contribution, or the specific contribution schedule of
each party. In addition, the remittance documents from these individuals lacked clear
information on the remitters, and in some cases, the funds were transferred by other parties on
their behalf with various descriptions. The project has been revoked by the People’s Committee
of Phu Tho Province. As of October 25, 2024, the Company had refunded a total amount of
VND 3,080,000,000 to the individuals corresponding to the amounts previously contributed;
however, the Company and the individuals have not yet signed the Liquidation minutes of those
