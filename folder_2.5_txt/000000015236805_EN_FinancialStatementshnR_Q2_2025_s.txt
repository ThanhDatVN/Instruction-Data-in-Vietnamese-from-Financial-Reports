reference to the specific costs incurred on the property sold and an allocation of any non­
specific costs based on the relative size of the property sold.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost incurred in bringing each product to its present
location and condition, and net realizable value.

Merchandise - cost of purchase on a weighted average basis
Tools and supplies - cost of purchase on a weighted average basis
Provision for obsolete inventories
An inventory provision is created for the estimated loss arising due to the impairment of value
(through diminution, damage, obsolescence, etc.) of raw materials, finished goods, and other

Dividends
Income is recognized when the Company’s entitlement as an investor to receive the dividend
is established.
3.19 Taxation
Current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior period are measured at the
amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax
laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted as at the balance sheet date.
Current income tax is charged or credited to the separate income statement, except when it
relates to items recognized directly to equity, in which case the current income tax is also
dealt with in equity.
Current income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right for the
Company to offset current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and when the
Company intends to settle its current income tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

3.19 Taxation (continued)
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet method on temporary differences at the
balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts
for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:
► where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in
a transaction which at the time of the related transaction affects neither the accounting
profit nor taxable profit or loss;
► in respect of taxable temporarily differences associated with investments in subsidiaries
and associates, and interests in joint ventures where timing of the reversal of the
temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward
unused tax credit and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit
will be available against which deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax
credit and unused tax losses can be utilized, except:
► where the deferred tax asset in respect of deductible temporary difference which arises
from the initial recognition of an asset or liability which at the time of the related
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;
► in respect of deductible temporarily differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are
recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse
in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary
differences can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available
to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Previously unrecognized deferred
tax assets are re-assessed at each balance sheet date and are recognized to the extent that
it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax assets to be
recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws
that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the separate income statement, except when it relates
to items recognized directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in the
equity account.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right for the
Company to off-set current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on:
> either the same taxable entity: or
► when the Company intends either settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or
to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which
significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or
recovered.
