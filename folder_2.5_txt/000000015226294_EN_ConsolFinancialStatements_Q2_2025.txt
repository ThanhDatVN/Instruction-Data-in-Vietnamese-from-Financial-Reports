last working day of the accounting period if the difference between this spot exchange rate and the
weighted average of the buying and selling exchange rate ruling on the last working day of the

uses the weighted average of the buying and selling exchange rate ruling on the last working day of the
accounting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than VND are
translated to VND at spot exchange rates ruling on transaction dates.

rate differences arising from the revaluation of foreign currency assets and liabilities to VND on the
monthly reporting date are recorded in the ’’Foreign exchange differences" account on the consolidated

IX- Financial risk management
38. Risk management related to financial instruments
Risk is always inherent in the Bank’s operation but it is managed by detective procedures, periodical
evaluation and control depending on the risk limit and other existed controls. The risk management
process is critical to the Bank’s profitability and each individual of the Bank has responsibility to
prevent risks relating to their work. The Bank has exposure to risks such as: credit risk, liquidity risk,
market risk (classified as business risk and non-business risk). In addition, the Bank also exposed to
operational risk.
The independent risk control process does not take into account business risks such as changes in
environment, technology and industry structure. These risks are controlled by strategy planning
process of the Bank.

39. Credit risk
Credit risk is the possibility of loss in the Group’s operations due to customers' failure or inability to
perform their obligations as committed.
In order to performing credit risk management, the Bank issued credit policies and instructions to
standardise credit activities of the Bank.
The Bank controls and manages the credit risk by establishing credit limit based on the level of risk
that the Bank can accept with each customer, each geographical area and each industry. The credit
limit of each customer is established by using the credit rating system in which each customer would
be classified at each specific risk level. This level can be changed and updated regularly.
The Bank has established the credit quality review process that allows early prediction of changes in
financial position and credit-worthiness of counterparties based on qualitative and quantitative factors.
40. Market risk
a. Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. The Bank will expose to interest rate risk when there is a gap between
maturity date or interest repricing date of assets, liabilities and off-statement of financial position
commitments in a specific period of lime.
The Bank usually monitors interest rate gaps, compares the domestic market with international market
for timely adjustments. In addition, the application of internal risk management became more effective
thanks to the deployment of Internal Funds Transfer Pricing System and Concentrated Payment
System, so that all capital and payment transactions of the Bank arc performed by the Head Office.
This helps the Bank monitor the capital changes and reduce the potential errors as well as the
unnecessary complicated procedures more effectively.
Analysis of assets and liabilities in term of interest repricing period
The interest repricing period is the period from the reporting date to earlier of contractual repricing
date or maturity date of assets and liabilities, depend on which factors come sooner.
The following assumptions and conditions arc applied in analysing the interest repricing period of
assets and liabilities of the Bank:
■ Cash on hand; derivatives and other financial assets; long-term investments; other assets
(including fixed assets and other assets) and other liabilities are categorised as interest free.
■ Balances with the SBV are classified as demand deposits so the interest repricing period is
categorised as up to 1 month.
■ The actual interest rate reset period of investment securities is calculated based on the actual
maturity period at the end of the fiscal year for each type of security.
■ The interest repricing period of deposits with and loans to other credit institutions; loan to
customers; due to and borrowings from other credit institutions and deposits from customers are
defined as follows:
Items with the fixed interest rate during the contract term: the interest repricing period is from
the end of accounting period to maturity date.
Items with the variable interest rate: the interest repricing period is from the end of accounting
period to the earlier of contractual repricing date or maturity date.
■ The actual interest rate reset period for issued valuable papers is based on the remaining
maturity period of each type of valuable paper.

c. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank has difficulties in fulfilling its obligations for financial
liabilities. Liquidity risk arises when the Bank does not have ability to fulfil the payment obligations
when financial liabilities are due under both normal and stressed conditions. To reduce the liquidity
risk, the Bank has to mobilise from various capitals besides the basic capital of the Bank has asset
management policies which have flexible liquidity, follow the future cash flows and daily liquidity.
The Bank should evaluate the expected cash flows and available ability of current guaranteed assets
in case of mobilising more capital.
Liquidity risk is limited by holding a large amount of cash and cash equivalents under demand deposits
with other credit institutions, balances with the SBV and other credit institutions and valuable papers.
Safety ratio that taken into account risk factor arc also used to manage liquidity risk.
The maturity period of assets and liabilities represents the remaining term of the assets and liabilities
from the date of the consolidated financial statements to the payment date as stipulated in the contract
or issuance terms.
The following assumptions and conditions arc applied in analysing the maturity of assets and liabilities
of the Bank:
■ Balances with the SBV are classified as demand deposits, included compulsory reserve. The
balance of compulsory reserve depends on elements and term of deposits from customers of the Bank.
■ The maturity of due from and loans to other credit institutions, derivatives and other financial
assets and loans to customers are determined based on the contractual maturity date. The actual
maturity date can be changed as the loans contracts are extended.
■ The maturity of investment securities is based on the contractual maturity date of each
securities.
■ The maturity of long-term equity investments is categorised over 5 years because these
investments do not have exact maturity date and the Bank has intention to hold them in long-term.
■ The maturity of fixed assets is determined by the remaining useful lives of assets.
■ The maturity of due to and borrowings from other credit institutions and deposits from
customers is determined based on the characteristics of each type or the maturity date specified in the
contracts. Demand deposits from other credit institutions and customers are perfonned as
requirements of customer and categorised as call deposits. The maturity for borrowings and tenn
deposits are determined based on contractual maturity date. In practice, they can be renewed and
therefore the actual maturities of those assets and liabilities may be longer than the original contractual
terms.
