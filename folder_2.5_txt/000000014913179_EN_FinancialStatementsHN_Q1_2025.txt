IV. APPLIED ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1. Basis for the Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis (except for cash flow
information).TAN CANG WAREHOUSING JOINT STOCK COMPANY
Address: Tan Cang - Cat Lai Terminal, Cat Lai Ward, Thu Duc City, Ho Chi Minh City
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS QUARTER I
For the Fiscal year ended December 31,2025_______________________________________________________
2. Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Parent Company and the
financial statements of its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Parent Company.
Control exists when the Parent Company has the ability to directly or indirectly influence the financial
and operating policies of the subsidiary to obtain economic benefits from its activities. In determining
control, potential voting rights arising from options or convertible debt and equity instruments that could
convert into common shares as of the fiscal year-end are also considered.
The operating results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are presented in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss from the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale of the investment in the
subsidiary.
The financial statements of the Parent Company and subsidiaries used for consolidation are prepared for
the same fiscal year and apply uniform accounting policies for similar transactions and events under
similar circumstances. In cases where the accounting policies of a subsidiary differ from the policies
applied uniformly by the Parent Company and other subsidiaries, adjustments are made to the
subsidiary’s financial statements before consolidation.
The balances of accounts on the consolidated balance sheet between the Parent Company and its
subsidiaries, intercompany transactions, and any unrealized intercompany profits arising from these
transactions must be fully eliminated. Any unrealized losses arising from intercompany transactions are
also eliminated unless the cost that led to the loss is not recoverable.
Non-controlling interest represents the portion of profit or loss and net assets in a subsidiary not owned
by the Parent Company and is presented as a separate item in the consolidated statement of profit or loss
and the consolidated balance sheet (under equity). Non-controlling interests include the value of the non­
controlling interest at the date of initial business combination and the portion of non-controlling interests
in the changes of equity since the business combination. Losses incurred by a subsidiary are allocated to
the non-controlling interests in proportion to their ownership, even if the losses exceed the non­
controlling interests’ share in the net assets of the subsidiary.
When the Parent Company invests to increase its ownership in a subsidiary, the difference between the
cost of the additional investment and the carrying value of the subsidiary’s net assets acquired at the
purchase date is recognized directly in the "Retained Earnings" section of the consolidated balance sheet.
3. Foreign Currency Transactions
Foreign currency transactions are converted at the exchange rate on the transaction date. The balances
of monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at the fiscal year-end are converted at the exchange
rate on that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising during the year from foreign currency transactions are recognized
in financial income or financial expenses. Foreign exchange differences from the revaluation of monetary
items denominated in foreign currencies at the fiscal year-end, after offsetting the gains and losses, are
recognized in financial income or financial expenses.
The exchange rate used for converting foreign currency transactions is the actual exchange rate at the
time the transaction occurs. The actual exchange rate for foreign currency transactions is determined as
follows:
• For receivables: the buying exchange rate of the commercial bank where the Parent Company and
subsidiaries instruct customers to make payments at the time the transaction occurs.
• For payables: the selling exchange rate of the commercial bank where the Parent Company and
subsidiaries expect to settle transactions at the time the transaction occurs.TAN CANG WAREHOUSING JOINT STOCK COMPANY
Address: Tan Cang - Cat Lai Terminal, Cat Lai Ward, Thu Duc City, Ho Chi Minh City
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS QUARTER I
For the fiscal year ended December 31,2025
® For purchases of assets or expenses paid immediately in foreign currencies (not through accounts
payable): the buying exchange rate of the commercial bank where the Parent Company and
subsidiaries make the payment.
The exchange rate used for revaluing the balances of monetary items denominated in foreign currencies
at the fiscal year-end is determined according to the following principles:
• For foreign currency deposits: the buying exchange rate of the bank where the Parent Company and
subsidiaries open foreign currency accounts.
• For monetary items denominated in foreign currencies classified as other assets: the buying
exchange rate of Military Commercial Joint Stock Bank (An Phu Branch) (the bank that the Parent
Company and subsidiaries regularly transact with).
» For monetary items denominated in foreign currencies classified as payables: the selling exchange
rate of Military Commercial Joint Stock Bank (An Phu Branch) (the bank that the Parent Company
and subsidiaries regularly transact with).
4. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits with banks. Cash equivalents arc short-term
investments with a maturity of no more than three months from the investment date, which can be easily
converted into a known amount of cash with no risk of change in value at the reporting date.
5. Financial Investments
Investments Held to Maturity
An investment is classified as held to maturity when the Company Group has the intent and ability to
hold it until maturity. The Company Group’s held-to-maturity investments consist solely of time deposits
with banks. Interest income from time deposits is recognized in the statement of profit or loss on an
accrual basis.
investments in Associates
An associate is an entity in which the Company Group has significant influence but does not control the
financial and operating policies. Significant influence is evidenced by the ability to participate in
decisions about the financial and operating policies of the investee, but not control those policies.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method, the investment
in an associate is initially recognized at cost, and adjusted for changes in the investor’s share of the net
assets of the associate after the investment date. If the Company Group’s share of losses in the associate
equals or exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the investment is carried at zero value unless
the Company Group has obligations to make payments on behalf of the associate.
The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same fiscal period as the consolidated
financial statements of the Company Group. If the accounting policies of the associate differ from those
applied by the Company Group, adjustments are made to the associate’s financial statements before
consolidation.
Unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated in proportion to the
Company Group’s share of the associate when preparing the consolidated financial statements.
6. Receivables
Receivables are presented at their book value less any provision for doubtful accounts.
Receivables are classified as receivables from customers and other receivables according to the following
principles:TAN CANG WAREHOUSING JOINT STOCK COMPANY
Address: Tan Cang - Cat Lai Terminal, Cat Lai Ward, Thu Duc City, Ho Chi Minh City
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS QUARTER I
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025_______________________________________________________
® Receivables from customers represent commercial receivables arising from sales transactions
between the Company, its subsidiaries, and independent third-party buyers.
® Other receivables reflect non-commercial receivables that are not related to sales transactions.
A provision for doubtful debts is made for each specific doubtful receivable after offsetting any related
payables (if any). The provision is based on the aging of overdue receivables or the estimated loss that
may occur, as follows:
® For overdue receivables:
30% of the value for receivables overdue from 6 months to less than 1 year.
50% of the value for receivables overdue from 1 year to less than 2 years.
70% of the value for receivables overdue from 2 years to less than 3 years.
100% of the value for receivables overdue from 3 years or more.
• A provision is made based on the estimated loss for receivables that are not yet overdue but are
considered difficult to collect.
Changes in the provision for doubtful debts at the fiscal year-end are recognized as administrative
expenses.
7. Inventories
Inventories are recognized at the lower cost and net realizable value.
The cost of raw materials includes purchase costs and other directly attributable costs to bring the
inventory to its current location and condition.
The cost of inventories is determined using the weighted average method and is accounted for
periodically.
The Company's inventory primarily consists of materials and spare parts held for the replacement and
repair of machinery, equipment, and transport vehicles. These inventories are well-maintained, and there
is no need to create a provision for inventory write-down.
8. Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses include actual expenses incurred but related to multiple accounting periods. Prepaid
expenses primarily consist of tools and supplies, insurance premiums, and repair costs for fixed assets.
These expenses are amortized over the periods of benefit or the corresponding periods in which these
expenses contribute to generating economic benefits.
Tools and Supplies
Tools and supplies in use are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding 3 years.
Insurance Expenses
Insurance expenses, including life insurance, health insurance, fire and explosion insurance, and vehicle
insurance, are amortized over the term of the insurance policy.
Repair Costs for Fixed Assets
One-time repair costs for fixed assets with significant value are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
period not exceeding 3 years.
9. Operating Lease AssetsTAN CANG WAREHOUSING JOINT STOCK COMPANY
Address: Tan Cang - Cat Lai Terminal, Cat Lai Ward, Thu Duc City, Ho Chi Minh City
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS QUARTER I
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2025
Leased assets are classified as operating leases if the majority of the risks and benefits related to the
ownership of the assets belong to the lessor. Operating lease expenses are recognized as expenses on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, regardless of the lease payment method.
10. Tangible Fixed Assets
Tangible fixed assets are presented at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of tangible fixed
assets includes all expenses the Company Group incurs to acquire the asset and prepare it for its intended
use. Subsequent costs are capitalized as part of the asset’s value only if they increase the future economic
benefits associated with the asset. Expenses that do not meet these criteria are recorded as operating
expenses for the period in which they are incurred.
When a tangible fixed asset is sold or disposed of, its cost and accumulated depreciation are written off,
and any gain or loss from the disposal is recognized in the income or expenses for the period.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives.
The depreciation periods for various types of tangible fixed assets are as follows:
Asset Type Depreciation Period (Years)
Buildings and structures 5-25
Machinery and equipment 3-10
Vehicles and transportation equipment 6-10
Management tools and equipment 3-10
Other fixed assets 3-10
11. Intangible Fixed Assets
Intangible fixed assets are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization.
The cost of intangible fixed assets includes all expenses incurred by the Company Group to acquire the
asset until it is ready for use. Costs incurred after initial recognition are recognized as operating expenses
unless they are directly associated with a specific intangible fixed asset and increase its economic
benefits.
When an intangible fixed asset is sold or disposed of, its cost and accumulated amortization are written
off, and any gain or loss from disposal is recognized in income or expenses for the year.
The Company Group’s intangible fixed assets mainly consist of computer software. The costs related to
the software, not tied to related hardware, are capitalized. The cost of the software is the total amount
spent until the software is ready for use. Software is amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 years.
12. Construction in Progress
Construction in progress reflects costs directly related (including interest expenses as per the Company
Group’s accounting policy) to assets under construction, machinery, and equipment being installed for
production, leasing, and management purposes, as well as costs related to repairs of fixed assets under
execution. These assets are recorded at cost and are not depreciated.
13. Joint Ventures
For joint ventures where the Company Group has joint control, the following items are recognized in the
consolidated financial statements:
® The value of the assets currently owned by the Company Group.
® The liabilities that the Company Group is responsible for.
0 Revenues derived from the sale of goods or provision of services by the joint venture.
® The expenses the Company Group is responsible for.TAN CANG WAREHOUSING JOINT STOCK COMPANY

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS QUARTER I
For the fiscal year ended December 31,2025_______________________________________________________
14. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses
Accounts payable and accrued expenses are recorded for amounts owed in the future for goods and
services received. Accrued expenses are recorded based on reasonable estimates of the amounts owed.
The classification of accounts payable is as follows:
® Accounts payable to suppliers: Reflects trade payables arising from purchases of goods, services,
and assets, with suppliers independent of the Company Group and its subsidiaries.
® Accrued expenses: Reflects amounts owed for goods or services received but not yet paid for, due
to the absence of invoices or incomplete documentation, as well as amounts due to employees for
wages, leave pay, and other accrued production costs.
• Other payables: Refiects amounts owed unrelated to commercial transactions.
Accounts payable and accrued expenses are classified as current or non-current based on the remaining
term as of the year-end date in the consolidated balance sheet.
15. Shareholders’ Equity
Shareholders' equity is recorded at the actual capital contributed by the Company’s shareholders.
16. Profit Distribution
Net profit after corporate income tax is distributed to shareholders after allocating funds according to the
Company’s charter and legal regulations, as approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
The distribution considers non-cash items in retained earnings that may affect cash flow and the ability
to pay dividends, such as gains from revaluation of contributed assets, currency revaluation, financial
instruments, and other non-cash items.
Dividends are recognized as liabilities once approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders.
17. Revenue and Income Recognition
Revenue from Service Provision
Revenue from service provision is recognized when all the following conditions are met:
• Revenue is reasonably certain. If the contract allows the buyer to return the purchased service under
specific conditions, revenue is only recognized once these conditions no longer apply and the buyer
loses the right to return the service.
• The Company Group has or will receive economic benefits from the service provision transaction.
• The portion of work completed at the reporting date can be identified.
® The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the service provision can be
determined.
In cases where the service is provided over multiple periods, revenue is recognized based on the
percentage of work completed at the end of the financial year.
Interest Income
Interest income is recognized based on the time period and effective interest rate for each period.
Dividends and Profit Sharing
Dividends and profit sharing are recognized when the Company Group is entitled to receive dividends
or profit from its investments. Dividends received in the form of additional shares are only recorded as
the number of shares increased, without recognizing the value of the shares received.TAN GANG WAREHOUSING JOINT STOCK COMPANY

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS QUARTER I
For the fiscal year ended December 31,2025
18. Borrowing Costs
Borrowing costs include interest expenses and other costs directly related to loans.
Borrowing costs are recognized as expenses when incurred.
19. Expenses
Expenses are costs that reduce economic benefits, recorded when the transaction occurs or when it is
reasonably certain that an expense will occur in the future, regardless of whether cash has been paid.
Expenses and the revenue generated from them must be recognized simultaneously based on the
matching principle. In case of a conflict between the matching principle and prudence, expenses are
recognized based on the nature and regulations of accounting standards to ensure transactions are
reported accurately and fairly.
20. Corporate Income Tax
Corporate income tax expenses include current income tax and deferred income tax.
Current Income Tax
Current income tax is calculated based on taxable income. Differences between taxable income and
accounting profit are caused by temporary differences, non-deductible expenses, non-taxable income,
and carried-forward losses.
Deferred Income Tax
Deferred income tax arises from temporary differences between the book value of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all
taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that there will
be future taxable income to offset the temporary differences.
'fhe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each financial year and is reduced
to the extent that it is no longer likely that sufficient taxable income will be available to use all or part of
the deferred tax asset. Deferred tax assets that were not previously recognized are reviewed at the end of
each financial year and recognized when it is probable that there will be enough taxable income to utilize
these deferred tax assets.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rate that is expected to apply in the
year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates in effect at the end of the
financial year. Deferred tax is recognized in the income statement, except when it is related to items
directly recognized in equity, in which case it is recognized directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when:
• The Company and its subsidiaries have a legal right to offset current tax assets and liabilities; and
• The deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to the same tax authority:
For the same taxable entity; or
The Company and its subsidiaries intend to settle the current tax liabilities and current tax
assets on a net basis or to recover the assets simultaneously with the settlement of deferred
income tax liabilities or assets in the future.
21. Related Parties
Parties are considered related if one party has the ability to control or significantly influence the other
party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also considered related if they share
common control or significant common influence.TAN CANG WAREHOUSING JOINT STOCK COMPANY

or provision of goods and services and has risks and economic benefits different from other business
segments.
