Address: 96 Ha Huy Giap, Tran Bien Ward, For the accounting period from
Dong Nai Province January 01, 2025 to June 30, 2025
Financial statements prepared in foreign currency are converted to financial statements prepared in Vietnamese Dong
(VND) using the following exchange rates: assets and liabilities are converted at the end-of-period exchange rate,
owner's equity is converted at the exchange rate on the date of investment, and the income statement and cash flow
statement are converted at the average exchange rate for the accounting period.
2.6 . Foreign currency transactions
The exchange rate used to convert foreign currency transactions is the actual exchange rate ruling as at the time of these
transactions. The actual exchange rates applied to foreign currency transactions are as follows:
For the foreign currency trading contract : the exchange rate stipulated in the contracts of trading foreign currency
between the Group and the Bank
For capital contribution made or received: the buying rate of the bank where the Corporation opens its account to
receive capital contributed from investors as of the date of capital contribution.
For receivables: the buying rate ruling as at the time of transactions of the commercial bank where the Corporation
designates the customers to make payments
For payables: the selling rate ruling as at the time of transactions of the commercial bank where the Corporation
supposes to make payment.
For acquisition of assets or immediate payments in foreign currency (not included into payable accounts): the
buying rate of the commercial bank where the Corporation makes payments.
The exchange rates used to re-evaluate the ending balances of monetary items in foreign currencies are determined
according to the following principles:
For monetary items in foreign currencies classified as other assets: Apply the foreign exchange buying rate of the
commercial bank where the Corporation frequently conducts transactions
For foreign currency deposits: the buying rate of the bank where the Corporation opens its foreign currency account.
For monetary items in foreign currencies classified as other liabilities: Apply the foreign exchange selling rate of the
commercial bank where the Corporation frequently conducts transactions
All actual exchange differences arising during the period and differences from revaluing the balances of monetary items
denominated in foreign currencies at the end of the period are recorded in the income statement of the accounting period.
2.7 . Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand, cash in funds, demand deposits at banks, and cash in transit.
Cash equivalents are short-term investments with original maturities not exceeding 03 months, high liquidity, easy
convertibility to cash, and minimal risk of value changes.
2.8 . Financial investments
Trading securities are initially recognized in the accounting books at cost, which includes the purchase price plus any
associated acquisition costs (if applicable), such as brokerage fees, transaction fees, information service fees, taxes, and
bank charges. After initial recognition, trading securities are measured at cost less any allowance for devaluation of
trading securities. Upon disposal or transfer, the cost of trading securities is determined using the weighted-average
method.
Held-to-maturity investments include term deposits held until maturity for the purpose of earning periodic interest, and
other investments held to maturity
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates acquired during the period are recognized by the acquirer at
the acquisition date and measured at the investment cost, with accounting procedures applied in accordance with the
standards for "Business Combinations" and "Investments in joint ventures, associates." In the Consolidated Financial
Statements, investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Investments in equity instruments of other entities include investments where the Corporation has no control, joint
control, or significant influence over the investee. The initial carrying value of these investments is measured at cost.
After initial recognition, their carrying value is measured at cost less any allowance for devaluation of the investment.TIN NGHIA CORPORATION Consolidated Financial Statements
Address: 96 Ha Huy Giap, Tran Bien Ward, For the accounting period from
Dong Nai Province January 01,2025 to June 30, 2025
Provisions for investment devaluation are established at the end of the period based on the following criteria:
For trading securities investments: The provision is based on the difference between the cost of investments
recorded in the accounting books and their market value at the time the provision is established, if the cost exceeds
the market value.
For long-term investments (excluding trading securities) where the Corporation does not have significant influence
over the investee: If the investment is in listed shares or its fair value can be reliably determined, the provision is
based on the market value of the shares. If the fair value cannot be determined at the reporting date, the provision is
based on the financial statements of the investee at the time the provision is established.
For held-to-maturity investments: The provisions/allowances for doubtful debts are based on recoverability, and are
made in accordance with legal regulations.
2.9 . Receivables
Receivables are tracked in detail based on their maturity, counterparties, type of currency, and other factors as required
for the Corporation's management purposes.
Provisions/allowances for doubtful debts are made for: overdue receivables as stated in economic contracts, loan
agreements, contract commitments, or debt agreements; and receivables not yet due but deemed unlikely to be collected.
Provisions for overdue receivables are based on the original payment terms in the sales contract, excluding any
extensions agreed upon by the parties. Provisions for receivables not yet due are applied when the debtor is bankrupt,
undergoing dissolution procedures, missing, or has fled.
2.10 . Inventories
Inventories are initially recognized at cost, which includes purchase costs, processing costs, and other directly
attributable costs incurred to bring the inventories to their present location and condition. After initial recognition, at the
time of preparing the financial statements, if the net realizable value of inventories is lower than their cost, inventories
are recorded at the net realizable value.
The value of inventories is determined using the weighted-average method.
Inventories are accounted for using the perpetual inventory system
Method for determining the value of work-in-process inventories at year-end:
For construction activities: Construction-in-progress costs are accumulated by unfinished projects or projects for
which revenue has not yet been recognized, corresponding to the volume of unfinished work at year-end.
- For manufacturing activities: Work-in-process costs are accumulated based on actual costs incurred for each type of
unfinished product.
Provisions for inventory devaluation are made at year-end based on the difference between the cost of inventories and
their net realizable value when the cost exceeds the net realizable value.
2.11 . Fixed assets
Tangible and intangible fixed assets are initially recognized at cost. During use, tangible and intangible fixed assets are
recorded at their historical cost, accumulated depreciation, and net book value.
Finance leased fixed assets are recorded at cost based on fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments
(whichever is higher), plus any direct initial costs related to the finance lease activity (excluding VAT). During usage, the
finance leased fixed assets are recorded at cost, accumulated depreciation, and remaining value. Depreciation of finance
leased fixed assets is calculated based on the lease term as per the contract and is included in the production and business
expenses to ensure full capital recovery.
Depreciation of fixed assets is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:TIN NGHIA CORPORATION Consolidated Financial Statements

- Industrial park infrastructure 10-45 years
2.12 . Business Cooperation Contract (BCC)
A Business Cooperation Contract (BCC) is an agreement between two or more parties to jointly carry out economic
activities without establishing a separate legal entity. This activity can be jointly controlled by the contributing parties as
per the joint venture agreement or controlled by one of the participating parties.

Expenses incurred that relate to production and business activities over multiple accounting periods are recorded as
prepaid expenses and gradually allocated to business results in subsequent accounting periods.
The calculation and allocation of long-term prepaid expenses into production and business costs for each accounting
period are based on the nature and scale of each expense type to select an appropriate allocation method and basis.
Prepaid expenses are allocated to production and business costs using the straight-line method.
Business goodwill arising from the equitization of state-owned enterprises is amortized over a maximum of 10 years,
following the guidelines in Circular No. 138/2012/TT-BTC dated August 20, 2012, on the allocation of goodwill value
for joint-stock companies converted from state-owned enterprises.

Payables are tracked according to payment terms, creditors, currency types, and other factors as required by the
company's management.

and liabilities in foreign currencies, they are tracked in detail by the original currency.
2.16 . Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognized as production and business expenses in the year they are incurred, except for borrowing
costs directly related to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets, which are capitalized into the
asset's value in accordance with the conditions specified in Vietnam Accounting Standard No. 16 “Borrowing Costs”.

- The company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a past event.
- It is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.

The recognized value of a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the
end of the financial year.
Only expenses related to the initially established provision may be offset against that provision.
Provisions are recognized as production and business costs for the financial year. Any unused provision established in
the prior reporting period that exceeds the required provision for the current reporting period is reversed and recorded as
a reduction in production and business costs, except for excess provisions for construction warranties, which are reversed
into other income in the financial year.
2.19 . Unearned revenue
Unearned revenue consists of advance payments received from customers, such as prepaid amounts for one or multiple
accounting periods related to asset leases.
Unearned revenue is recognized as revenue from sales of goods and services in amounts allocated to each accounting

price of shares (including the re-issuance of treasury shares). This difference can be positive (if the issuance price
exceeds the par value and direct costs) or negative (if the issuance price is below the par value and direct costs).
Other equity funds reflect equity formed from business results, donations, grants, asset revaluations (if permitted to
adjust the owner’s contributed capital).
Retained earnings reflect the net income (or loss) after corporate income tax and the allocation of profit or loss.
Distribution of profit is carried out when the undistributed profit after tax does not exceed the amount shown on the
consolidated financial statements after excluding gains from bargain purchase transactions. If dividends or profits are
paid beyond the undistributed profit, they are recognized as a reduction of contributed capital. Undistributed profit after
tax may be distributed to investors proportionally to their capital contributions after approval by the General Meeting of
Shareholders and deduction of statutory reserves as per the company’s charter and applicable laws.
