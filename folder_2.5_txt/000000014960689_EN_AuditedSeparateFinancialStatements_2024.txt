INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To: The shareholders, The Board of Directors and Management
INDOCHINE IMPORT EXPORT INVESTMENT INDUSTRIAL JOINT STOCK COMPANY
We have audited the accompanying separate financial statements of Indochine Import Export Investment
Industrial Joint Stock Company prepared on 14 May 2025, as set out on pages from 09 to 50, which comprises the
separate balance sheet as at 31 December 2024, the separate income statement, the separate cash flow statement
for the year then ended and the Notes to the separate financial statements.
The Board of Management's responsibility
The Board of Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
separate financial statements in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Accounting
System for enterprises and statutory requirements relevant to preparation and presentation of the separate financial
statements, and for such internal control as the Board of Management determines is necessary to enable the
preparation and presentation of the separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.
Auditors' responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these separate financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with Vietnamese Audit Standards. Those standards require that we comply
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
separate financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
separate financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the separate financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and fair in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board of
Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the separate financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
qualified audit opinion. Oto;

Email: info@aascs.com.vn Website: www.aascs.com.vnBasis for qualified opinion
During the year, pursuant to the Board of Directors’ Decision No. 0201/2024/QD-DDG dated 31/05/2024, the
Company temporarily suspended depreciation for certain factories and machinery and equipment related to
projects that had not generated or did not generate revenue in 2024, with a total value of VND 17,107,112,648.
However, in our opinion, this suspension of depreciation is not in compliance with the prevailing accounting
regulations. If the Company were to adjust the above matter in accordance with current regulations, it would result
in an increase in depreciation expense, thereby decreasing (or causing a loss in) the "Profits after corporate
income tax" item on the Separate Income Statement (Code 60) and the “Undistributed earnings” item on the
Separate Balance Sheet (code 421) by the corresponding amount of VND 17,107,112,648, and would impact the
financial position and cash flows presented in the Company’s separate financial statements.
Qualified opinion
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in "Basis for qualified opinion" paragraph, the
separate financial statements give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the separate financial position of
Indochine Import Export Investment Industrial Joint Stock Company as at 31 December 2024, and of the separate
results of its operations and its separate cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Vietnamese ¿011729
Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Accounting System for enterprises and the statutory requirements relevant

Emphasis of matter ¡\KIEMTO
PHIANAN
We would like to draw attention to Note V.05 of the financial statements regarding “Other short-term
receivables.” As at 31/12/2024, the receivables from Mr. Nguyen Van Hop has a balance of VND 45,815,000,014
arising from the Company’s transfer of shares in its subsidiary - CL Joint Stock Company. The total value of this
transaction was VND 80,800,000,000 resulting in an increase in the Company’s financial income in 2024 of VND
55,550,000,000. However, at the issuance date of this audit report, the Company has only collected VND
34,984,999,986, and the remaining receivable of VND 45,815,000,014 has not yet been collected. Currently, the
Company and Mr. Nguyen Van Hop have entered into a pledge agreement securing the receivable with 2,590,000
shares of CL Joint Stock Company.
Additionally, as presented in Section VIII.4 - Going Concern Information - as at 31/12/2024, the "Short-term
liabilities" item (code: 310) on the Balance Sheet exceeds the "Short-term assets" item (code: 100) by VND
199,303,492,539. At the same time, the Company’s "Short-term borrowings and finance lease liabilities" (code:
320) include overdue amounts totaling VND 537,536,195,974 that have not yet been settled. This situation
reflects a low current ratio and may affect the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. However,
according to the Company’s explanation, management is actively negotiating with credit institutions, as well as
with organizations and individuals holding the Company’s bonds, to arrange for extensions of overdue debts. In
addition, the Company has received commitments from certain major shareholders and creditors to support the
Company in maintaining its going concern status.
7Our opinion is not modified in respect of these emphasis of matters.

(*) This represents the discrepancy in the outstanding balance of borrowings and finance lease liabilities as at
31/12/2024, between the Company’s accounting records and the balance confirmed by the Joint Stock Commercial
Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (see Note V.17). As the two parties have not yet reached an
agreement on this matter, the Company has no basis to resolve the discrepancy and has temporarily presented it under
the item “Surplus of assets awaiting resolution”. Once sufficient documentation and specific grounds are collected,

Reason for non-payment: The overall economic difficulties have severely impacted the Company's business operations. Additionally, banks have tightened their credit appraisal
and lending policies. As a result, when banks stop extending or issuing new credit limits for borrowing businesses, the Company's working capital experiences a significant
shortfall, leading to low payment cash flow. These factors have caused the Company to struggle with meeting its due debt obligations to the bank.INDOCHINE IMPORT EXPORT INVESTMENT INDUSTRIAL JOINT STOCK COMPANY Separate financial statements

(2) Regarding the borrowing from the Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV), the People’s Court of Binh Dinh Province issued
Judgment No. 04/2025/KDTM-PT dated 12/03/2025, requiring Indochina Import Export Industrial Investment Joint Stock Company to repay BIDV an amount calculated as of
26/09/2024, totaling VND 156,025,476,770, including: principal of VND 142,888,570,000 and interest and penalty interest of VND 13,136,906,770, and to continue to bear

BIDV loan under short-tenn borrowings (code: 320 on the Balance Sheet) and as overdue short-term borrowings and finance lease liabilities.
On the other hand, regarding the decrease during the year amounting to VND 26,114,800,328, this represents the discrepancy between the financial borrowing balance
recorded in the Company's accounting books and the balance confirmed by the Bank. According to the explanation provided by the Executive Board, the difference may have
arisen from the Bank’s release of collateral related to the loan. However, as the two parties have not yet reached an agreement on this matter, the Company does not have
sufficient grounds to resolve the discrepancy and has temporarily presented it under the item “Surplus of assets awaiting resolution” (see Note V.16).

6. INFORMATION ON PRIOR YEAR'S QUALIFIED OPINION
The qualified audit opinion for 2023 has been reviewed for its impact on the current year:
The separate financial statements for the fiscal year ended as at 31/12/2023 included a qualified opinion due to the
auditor’s inability to obtain certain confirmation letters for borrowings and finance lease liabilities. In these separate
financial statements, the Company has conducted a review, sent debt confirmation letters, and performed alternative
procedures to verify the balances of the mentioned borrowings and finance lease liabilities. As a result, the qualified
opinion in 2023 no longer has an impact that necessitates its inclusion in this audit report.
