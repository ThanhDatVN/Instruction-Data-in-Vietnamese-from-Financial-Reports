financial statements of the Parent Company and its Subsidiaries. Companies are identified as subsidiaries of
the Company when it is possible to control the financial and operating policies of the investee companies so

included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that
control ceases.
The accounting policies of the Subsidiaries may be adjusted to ensure that there is no material difference
between the accounting policies applied at the Parent Company and the Subsidiaries.
All major transactions (transactions) and balances between Subsidiaries within the same Group are
eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.

and be able to cover that loss.

financial and operating policies of the company. Associates are accounted for using the equity method. The
consolidated financial statements include the share enjoyed by the Parent Company in the income and
expenses of the associate, accounted for using the equity method, after adjustment for the Parent Company's
accounting policies, from the commencement to the date of cessation of significant influence over these
companies.
When the share of the associate's loss that the Parent Company must share exceeds the parent's interest in
the associate, accounted for using the equity method, the carrying amount of the investment (including long­
term investments, if any) are reduced to zero and future losses are derecognised, except for losses to the
extent that the Parent Company is obligated to pay or has paid on its behalf, for associated companies.1
