the interim results of its operations and its interim cash flows for the six-month accounting period then ended,

The Board of General Directors is responsible for ensuring that the accounting records are properly maintained

REVIEW REPORT ON INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
To: The Shareholders, the Board of Directors, the Board of Supervisors and
the Board of General Directors
BA RIA RUBBER JOINT STOCK COMPANY
We have reviewed the accompanying Interim Financial Statements of Ba Ria Rubber Joint Stock
Company (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”), prepared on 28 July 2025, from page 4 to page
40, which comprise the Interim Balance Sheet as at 30 June 2025, the Interim Income Statement, the
Interim Cash Flows Statement for the six-month accounting period then ended, and the accompanying
Notes to the Interim Financial Statements.
The Board of General Directors’s Responsibility
The Board of General Directors of the Company is responsible for the true and fair preparation and
presentation of the Interim Financial Statements of the Company in accordance with Vietnamese
Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting System, and relevant legal regulations
related to the preparation and presentation of Interim Financial Statements. The Board of General
Directors is also responsible for such internal control as it determines it is necessary to enable the
preparation and presentation of Interim Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Interim Financial Statements based on our review.
We conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on Review Engagements 2410 -
Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity.
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Vietnamese Standards on
Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of
all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion.
Auditor’s Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying Interim Financial Statements do not present in a true and fair view, in all material
respects, the interim financial position of the Company as at 30 June 2025, and its interim results of
its operations and interim cash flows for the six-month accounting period then ended, in accordance
with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting System, and relevant
ulations related to the preparation and presentation of interim financial statements.

3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.1. Accounting Estimates
The preparation of the Interim Financial Statements in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting
Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting System, and relevant legal regulations relating to
the preparation and presentation of Interim Financial Statements requires the Board of General
Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of liabilities and assets,
the disclosure of contingent liabilities and assets as at the date of the Interim Financial Statements,

these accounting estimates are made based on the best knowledge and judgment of the Board of
General Directors, actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.
3.2. Transactions in foreign currencies
Operations arising in currencies other than the Company's accounting currency (USD) are recorded
at the actual exchange rate on the date of the transaction according to the following principles:
• Operations giving rise to receivables are recorded at the buying exchange rate of the commercial

• Operations giving rise to payables are recorded at the selling exchange rate of the commercial
bank where the Company plans to transact; and
• Transactions related to the purchases of assets or expenses to be paid immediately in foreign
currency (not using accounts payable) are recorded at the buying exchange rate of the commercial
bank at which the payment is made
The exchange rates used to revalue balances of monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at
the end of the six-month accounting period are determined as follows:
• For monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are classified as other assets: buying foreign
exchange rate of the Bank company regularly traded; and
• For monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are classified as liabilities: selling foreign
exchange rate of Bank company regularly traded.

hold until maturity. Held-to-maturity investments include: term bank deposits (including treasury bills,
promissory notes), bonds, preference shares that the issuer must redeem at a certain time in the
future, and loans held to maturity for the purpose of earning periodic interest and other held-to-maturity
investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are recognized on the date of acquisition and are initially measured at
cost, including the purchase price and any transaction costs. Interest income from investments held to
maturity after the acquisition date is recognized in the Income Statement on an accrual basis. Interest
earned before the Company holds the investment is deducted from the cost at the acquisition date.
Held-to-maturity investments are measured at cost less allowance for doubtful debts.
Allowance for doubtful debts of investments held to maturity is made in accordance with current
accounting regulations.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity in which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary
nor a joint venture of the Company. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and
operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The Company recognizes in its income statement the portion of the Company's income received from
the investee's accumulated net profits arising after the date of investment. Any other amount received
by the Company other than the profit received is considered a recovery of investment and is recorded
as a reduction in the cost of the investment.
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates are presented in the Interim Balance Sheet
at original cost less provision for impairment losses (if any). Provisions for impairment of such
investments are made when there is clear evidence of a decline in the value of these investments at
the end of the accounting period.
Investments in equity of other entities
Investments in equity of other entities represent investments in equity but the Company does not have
control, joint control or significant influence over the investee.
Investments in equity of other entities are stated at cost less provision for devaluation of financial
investments.
3.5. Receivables
Accounts receivable are amounts that are recoverable from customers or other entities. Accounts
receivable are presented at book value less allowances for doubtful debts.
Allowances for doubtful debts is made for each doubtful debt based on the age of overdue debts or
the expected level of loss that may occur.
3.6. Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventory includes
the cost of direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead, if any, in bringing the inventory
to its present location and condition.
The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average method.
11BA RIA RUBBER JOINT STOCK COMPANY Form B 09a - DN
NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Net realizable value is determined as the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completing
the product and the costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The Company's provision for devaluation of inventories is made in accordance with current accounting
regulations. Accordingly, the Company is allowed to make allowance for obsolete, damaged, or
substandard inventories and in cases where the cost of inventories is higher than their net realizable
value at the end of the accounting period.
3.7. Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of a fixed asset acquired through purchase includes the purchase price and ail other costs
directly related to putting the asset into a state of readiness for use. For fixed assets acquired through p
capital construction investment under the method of contracting or self-construction and production,
the cost is the final settlement price of the construction project according to current investment and
construction management regulations, other directly related costs and registration fees (if any). In case ,
the project has been completed and put into use but the final settlement has not been approved, the 1
cost of the fixed asset is recorded at the estimated cost based on the actual costs incurred to acquire
the fixed asset. The estimated cost will be adjusted according to the final settlement price approved
by competent authorities. 5
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives
as follows:
Current year
[Years]
Buildings and structures 08-20
Machinery and equipment 05-08
Office equipment 06-08
Motor vehicles 03-05
Depreciation of fixed assets for rubber plantations is carried out according to Official Dispatch No.
1937/BTC-TCDN dated February 9, 2010 of the Department of Corporate Finance - Ministry of Finance
on Depreciation of rubber plantations and Decision No. 221/QD - CSVN dated April 27, 2010 of the
Vietnam Rubber Industry Group on promulgating the depreciation rate of rubber plantations according
to the 20-year exploitation cycle; specifically as follows:
Year of exploitation Depreciation rate (%) Year of exploitation Depreciation rate (%)
Year 1st 2,50 Year 11th 7,00
Year 2nd 2,80 Year 12th 6,60
Year 3rd 3,50 Year 13th 6,20
Year 4th 4,40 Year 14th 5,90
Year 5th 4,80 Year 15th 5,50

Year 8th 5,10 Year 18th 5,00
Year 9th 5,10 Year 19th 5,20
Year 10th 5,00
The depreciation amount for each year is determined by multiplying the original cost of the rubber
plantation by the depreciation rate applicable for that year.
The depreciation rate for the final year (year 20) is determined by the residual value of the orchard in
the final year of exploitation.
12BA RIA RUBBER JOINT STOCK COMPANY Form B 09a - DN
NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Tangible fixed assets are revalued when there is a decision of the State or when a State-owned
enterprise is equitized. The original price and accumulated depreciation are adjusted according to the
revalued results approved by competent authorities as prescribed.
Profits and losses arising from the liquidation and sale of assets are the difference between the
proceeds from the liquidation and the remaining value of the assets and are recorded in the Interim
Income Statement
3.8. Intangible assets
Intangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.
The cost of intangible fixed assets includes all the expenses incurred by the Company to acquire the
fixed assets up to the time the asset is ready for use. Costs related to intangible fixed assets incurred
after initial recognition are recognized as production and business expenses in the period, unless these
expenses are associated with a specific intangible fixed asset and increase the economic benefits
from these assets. '
£
When intangible fixed assets are sold or disposed of, their cost and accumulated amortization are
eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is recognized as income
or expense in the period.
The Company's intangible fixed assets include:
Computer software
Costs relating to computer software programs that are not an integral part of the related hardware are
capitalized. The cost of computer software comprises all costs incurred by the Company up to the date
the software is put into use. Computer software is amortized using the straight-line method.
Copyright, patent
The cost of copyrights and patents acquired from third parties includes the purchase price, non-
refundable sales tax and registration costs. Copyrights and patents are amortized on a straight-line
basis over 10 years.
3.9. Operating leases
The Company recognises assets held under finance leases as assets of the Company at their fair
value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Interim Balance Sheet as a finance lease
liability. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and principal repayments so as to
achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance lease
costs are recognised in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets,
in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Company’s accounting policy on borrowing
costs (see below).
A lease is classified as an operating lease when the lessor retains a significant portion of the rewards
and is subject to the risks of ownership of the asset. Operating lease expenses are recognised in the
interim income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Consideration received or
receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease is also recognised on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their estimated useful lives in the same way as
owned assets. However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership at the
end of the lease term, the leased asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the asset's
useful life.
13BA RIA RUBBER JOINT STOCK COMPANY Form B 09a - DN
NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
3.10. Construction in progress
Assets under construction for production, rental, management or other purposes are recorded at
historical cost. These costs include costs necessary to form the asset, including construction,
equipment and other related costs in accordance with the Company's accounting policy. These costs
will be transferred to the original cost of fixed assets at the provisional price (if there is no approved
final settlement) when the assets are handed over for use.
According to the State's regulations on investment and construction management, depending on the
management level, the final settlement value of completed basic construction works must be approved
by competent authorities. Therefore, the final value of basic construction works may change and
depends on the settlement approved by competent authorities.

this period but related to the production output of the whole year have been allocated by the Company
according to the corresponding ratio between the actual rubber output exploited and processed in the
year and the rubber output exploited and processed according to the plan for the whole year. The

services.

3.16. Distribution of net profits

the Company's Charter as well as legal regulations and approved by the General Meeting of
Shareholders.
The distribution of profits to shareholders takes into account non-monetary items in undistributed
profits after tax that may affect cash flow and the ability to pay dividends such as interest on revaluation
of contributed assets, interest on revaluation of monetary items, financial instruments and other non­
monetary items.
Dividends payable to shareholders are recorded as payables on the Company's Balance Sheet after
the dividend payment notice of the Company's Board of Directors is approved by the General Meeting
of Shareholders and the dividend record date is announced by the Vietnam Securities Depository

16BA RIA RUBBER JOINT STOCK COMPANY Form B 09a - DN
NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Cost of goods sold includes the cost of products, goods and services rendered during the period and
is recorded in accordance with the revenue consumed during the period. Cost of direct materials
consumed in excess of the normal level, labor costs, fixed general production costs that are not

3.21. Taxation
Corporate income tax represents the total value of the current tax payable and the deferred tax
amount.
Current tax is calculated based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before
tax as reported in the Interim Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that
are taxable or deductible in other years (including losses carried forward, if any) and it further excludes
items that are not taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is calculated on the differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in
the financial statements and their tax bases and is accounted for using the balance sheet method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences, while deferred tax assets are
recognized only when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the
temporary differences can be used.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is
realised or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is recognised in the income statement and is
denominated in equity except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The determination of the Company's income tax is based on the prevailing tax regulations. However,
these regulations are subject to periodic change and the ultimate determination of the income tax
depends on the results of the tax authorities' examinations.
Other taxes are applied according to current tax laws in Vietnam.
3.22. Financial instruments

Currently, there are no regulations on revaluation of financial instruments after initial recognition.
3.23. Related parties

significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also
considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.
In considering any related party relationship, attention is directed more to the substance of the
relationship than to the legal form.

The Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while
maximizing the return to its shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The Company's capital structure comprises net debt and the Group's equity (comprising contributed
capital, reserves and retained earnings).

The Company has not determined the fair value of its financial assets and financial liabilities at the
balance sheet date because Circular No. 210/2009/TT-BTC issued by the Ministry of Finance on 06
November 2009 (“Circular 210”) as well as current regulations do not provide specific guidance on
determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities. Circular 210 requires the
application of International Financial Reporting Standards on the presentation of financial statements
and disclosure of information for financial instruments but does not provide equivalent guidance for
34BA RIA RUBBER JOINT STOCK COMPANY Form B 09a - DN
NOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
the measurement and recognition of financial instruments including the application of fair value, in
order to comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
6.4. Financial risk management objectives
The Company has established a risk management system to identify and assess the risks to which
the Company is exposed, and to establish policies and procedures to control risks at an acceptable
level. The risk management system is reviewed periodically to reflect changes in market conditions
and the Company's operations.
Financial risks include market risk (including exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit
risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk
The Company's business operations will be mainly exposed to risks from changes in foreign exchange
rates, interest rates and prices. The Company does not hedge these risks due to the lack of an active
market for trading these financial instruments.
Exchange rate risk management
The Company conducts a number of transactions denominated in foreign currencies, which exposes
the Company to risks of exchange rate fluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk arising from its signed interest-bearing loans. This risk
will be managed by the Company by maintaining a reasonable level of loans and analyzing the
competitive situation in the market to obtain favorable interest rates for the Company from appropriate
lending sources.
Commodity Price Risk Management
The Company purchases raw materials and goods from domestic and foreign suppliers to serve its i
production and business activities. Therefore, the Company will bear the risk of changes in the selling
price of raw materials and goods.
Credit risk
Credit risk occurs when a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations resulting in
a financial loss to the Company. The Company has a credit policy in place and regularly monitors the
situation to assess whether the Company is exposed to credit risk. The Company does not have any
significant credit risk exposure to customers or counterparties because receivables come from a large
number of customers operating in various industries and distributed across different geographical
areas.
Credit risk occurs when a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations, resulting
in financial losses to the Company. The Company has a suitable credit policy and regularly monitors
the situation to assess whether the Company is exposed to credit risk.
Liquidity risk management
The purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure the availability of funds to meet present and
future financial obligations. Liquidity is also managed by the Company to ensure that the excess of
maturing liabilities over maturing assets in any period is kept to manageable levels relative to the
amount of funds that the Company believes can be generated during that period. The Company's
policy is to regularly monitor current and expected liquidity requirements to ensure that the Company
maintains sufficient reserves ofcash, borrowings and adequate committed capital from owners to meet
its liquidity requirements in the short and longer term.

non-derivative financial liabilities and their agreed repayment terms. The tables have been presented
based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial assets and undiscounted cash flows of financial
liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Company can be required to pay. The presentation
of information on non-derivative financial assets is necessary in order to understand the Company’s
