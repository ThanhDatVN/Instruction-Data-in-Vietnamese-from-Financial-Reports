III. STAND ARTS AND APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1. APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The company applies Corporate Accounting System issued under the Circular No.200/2014/TT-
BTC dated 22 December 2014 by the Ministry of Finance and the Circular No.53/2016/TT-
BTC dated 21 March 2016 issued by Ministry of Finance amending and supplementing some
articles of the Circular No. 200/2014/TT-BTC.
2. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND
SYSTEM
The Company applied to Vietnamese Accounting Standards, Vietnamese Corporate Accounting
System promulgated under Circular 200/2014/TT-BTC dated 22 December 2014, Circulars
guiding the implementation of accounting standards of the Ministry of Finance and other related
legal regulations on preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements.3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies adopted by the Company in the preparation of these Interim
Consolidated Financial Statements are as follows:
3.1 BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company's financial statements and
the financial statements of companies controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) prepared for
the accounting period from 01 January 2024 to 30 June 2024. This control is achieved when the
Company has the ability to control the financial policies and operations of investee companies
in order to obtain benefits from their operations.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the period are presented in the Interim
Consolidated Income Statement from the date of purchase or until the date of sale of the
investment in that subsidiary.
Where necessary, the financial statements of subsidiaries are adjusted so that the accounting
policies applied at the Company and its subsidiaries are the same.
All operations and balances between companies in the same group are eliminated when
consolidating financial statements.
Non-controlling shareholder interests
Non-controlling shareholder interest in the net assets of the consolidated subsidiary is defined
as a separate indicator separated from the shareholders' equity portion of the parent company.
Non-controlling shareholder interests include the value of the non-controlling shareholder's
interests at the date of the initial business combination and the non-controlling shareholder's
share of the interest in the fluctuation of total equity since the date of the business combination.
Losses incurred at the subsidiary must be distributed in proportion to the non-controlling
shareholder's share, even if such losses are greater than the non-controlling shareholder's share
in the subsidiary's net assets.
Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for by the purchase method at the date of purchase, which
is the date on which control is transferred to the Company. Control exists when the Company
has the power to govern an entity's financial and operational policies in order to derive
economic benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the Company must consider the
potential voting rights that may be possible at the present time.
According to the purchase method, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
company to be purchased are determined at fair value at the date of purchase. Any extras
between the purchase price and the total fair value of the property purchased are noted as
goodwill. Any shortfall between the purchase price and the total fair value of the assets
purchased is recognized in the results of business operations of the accounting period in which
the purchase of the subsidiary arose.
Non-controlling shareholder interests at the date of initial business combination are determined
on the basis of the ratio of non-controlling shareholders to the total fair value of recognized
assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities.
Invest in affiliatesAn affiliate is a company over which the Company has significant influence but is not a
subsidiary or joint venture of the Company. Significant influence is reflected in the investee's
right to participate in decision-making on financial and operational policies but has no influence
in terms of controlling or co-controlling these policies. Typically, the Company is considered
to have significant influence if it owns more than 20% of the voting rights in the investee.
Investments in the Company's affiliates are accounted for according to the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognized on the consolidated balance
sheet at cost, then adjusted for changes in the Company's share in the net asset value of affiliated
companies after purchase. Goodwill arising from the investment in the affiliate company is
reflected in the residual value of the investment. The company does not allocate this goodwill
but annually performs an assessment of whether the goodwill has been impaired in value. The
consolidated income statement reflects the Company's ownership share in the affiliate's
business results after purchase.
When the share of the Affiliate's losses that the Company has to share exceeds the Company's
interest in the affiliate company accounted for under the equity method, the carrying value of
the investment will be written down to zero and stop the recognition of losses incurred in the
future except losses to the extent that the Company has obligations payable or paid on behalf
of affiliates.
IV. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1. FOREIGN CURRENCY
The exchange rate to convert transactions arising during the period in foreign currencies
is the exchange rate with the Commercial Bank where the Company has such transaction at the
transaction date.
The exchange rate when re-evaluating monetary items denominated in foreign currencies
at the time of preparation of the Interim Separate Financial Statements is the exchange rate
announced by the Commercial Bank where the foreign currency account is opened at the time
of preparation of the Interim Separate Financial Statements:
Particularly:
- The exchange rate used for translation of balances of monetary items is the buying
exchange rate at the period-end of Joint Stock Commercial Bank where transactions of the
Company have been regularly made.
- The exchange rate used for translation of deposits is the buying exchange rate of the bank
where accounts are opened.
- The exchange rate used for translation of balances of monetary payables is the selling
exchange rate at the period-end of Joint Stock Commercial Bank where transactions of the
Company have been regularly made.
2. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash includes cash on hand, demand and term deposits in banks. Cash equivalents are short­
term investments with a recovery period not exceeding 3 months from the date of investment,
capable of being easily converted into a specified amount of cash and without risks in
conversion into cash.
3. FINANCIAL INVESTMENTSHeld-to-maturity in vestments
Held-to maturity investments consist of investments amounts that the Company intends and is
able to hold to the maturity date. Held-to-maturity investments include: term deposits which
the issuer is required to re-buy them in a certain time in the future and held to maturity loans to
earn profits periodically and other held to maturity investments.
Held-to maturity investments are recognized starting from the acquisition date and initial value
of such held-to-maturity investments are determined under purchase price and expenses related
to transactions of purchasing investment amounts. Interest proceeds from held-to-maturity
investments after purchase date are recognized on the Income Statement on the basis of
estimates. Interest before the Company holds the investments shall be deducted from historical
cost at purchase time.
Held-to-maturity investments are determined as historical cost minus provisions for doubtful
and bad debts.

the losses can be reliably determined, the losses is recognized as financial expenses for the year <
/ period and reduce directly on investment value.
Investment in Subsidiaries
The investment presented is an investment in a Subsidiary when the Company acquires control /
of the invested entity. Control is the power to govern the separate financial and operating
policies of an enterprise or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities or business
activities.
An associate is a company in which the Company has significant influence but has no control
over the financial and operating policies and is not a subsidiary or joint venture of the Company.

policy decisions of the investee but does not affect control or co-control over these policies.
Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures or associate companies are initially recorded at
historical costs, which includes the purchase price or capital contribution plus direct investment
expenses. In the case of investments with non-monetary assets, the cost of the investment is
recorded at the fair value of the non-monetary assets at the arising time.
Dividends and profits for the periods before the investment is purchased are accounted for as a
decrease in value of such investment. Dividends and profits for the periods after the investment
is purchased and recorded as revenue. Dividends are received in shares and are only tracked by
the increased number of shares, do not record the value of shares received/recorded at par value.
Allowance for impairment of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates is
established at the time of Financial Statement preparation when investments in subsidiaries,
joint ventures or associates are made. For any decrease in comparison with the original price,
the Company will make the following provision:
If an investment in subsidiary, joint venture or associate companies whose listed shares
or the fair value of the investment is determined reliably, the allowance shall be made according
to the market value of the shares
- With regard to an investment whose fair value is not identifiable at the reporting time, the
allowance shall be made in an amount equal to the difference between the actual contributed
capital of the parties in the subsidiaryjoint venture, or associate company and the actual equity,
multiplied by the portion of the capital contribution of the Company compared with the actual
capital contribution of the parties in the subsidiaries, joint-ventures, or associates.
Investment in equity instruments of another entityInvestments in equity instruments of another entity include equity investments but the Company
does not have the right of control, co-control or have vital impact on the investee.
Investments in capital instruments of another entity are initially recognized at cost, including
purchase price or capital contribution plus direct costs related to investment activities.
Dividends and profits for periods before the investment is purchased are accounted for a
decrease in the value of the investment itself. Dividends and profits of periods after the
investment is purchased are recognized revenue. Dividends received in shares may only track
the number of additional shares, not recognize the value of shares received/recognized at par
value.
Provision for losses for investments in capital instruments of other entities set aside at the time
of preparing the mid-year Separate Financial Statements when the investments have a decline
compared to the original price, the Company shall make provision as follows:
- For an investment in listed shares or the fair value of a reliably determined investment,
provisioning is based on the market value of the shares.
- For an investment whose fair value cannot be determined at the time of reporting, the i
reserve shall be set aside with an appropriation equal to the difference between the actual
contributed capital of the parties in another unit and the actual equity multiplied by the ratio of
the Company's capital contribution compared to the total actual contributed capital of the parties
in another unit.
Increase or decrease the amount of provision for investment losses in capital instruments of
other entities that need to be set aside at the closing date of Consolidated Financial Statements

transactions.
Provision for doubtful debts is made for receivables which are overdue in the economic
contract, the contractual commitment or debt commitment and receivable debts which are not

set up at the closing date of the Interim Separate Financial Statements are recorded in the cost
of goods sold during the period.
