die principal price when received.
The risk provision for investment securities mentioned above will be refunded when the recoverable value of the securities increases after making provisions. Provisions shall be reimbursed only to die extent
that the book value of these securities does not exceed their book value assuming that no provisions have been recorded.

For the purposes of this separate financial statement, investments in subsidiaries are initially recorded at the original price. After initial recognition, these investments are determined according to the origina
price minus the provision for long-term investment price reduction.
Other long-term investments
Otlier long-term investments are long-term capital contributions to other companies over which the Bank does not have control or have significant influence. These long-term investments are initially recorded at
the original price and then reflected at the original price minus the provision for depreciation of long-term investments. A provision for securities price reduction shall be made when there is evidence of a
decrease in securities prices, specifically as follows:

and directly related costs to bring the assets to their location and operating status for tlieir intended use. Expenses incurred after tangible fixed assets have been put into operation such as repair, maintenance and
overhaul expenses shall be recorded in the statement of results of business activities in tlie year in which the expenses are incurred. In cases where it can be clearly demonstrated that these costs increase the
anticipated future economic benefit derived from the use of tangible fixed assets in excess of tlie standard operating level as originally assessed, these costs are capitalized as an additional cost of tlie fixed asset
fonn.
Depreciation is calculated using tlie straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of the tangible fixed asset. The estimated useful life is as follows:
houses, architectural objects 5-50 years
management equipment and instruments 3-8 years
means of transport 6-10 years
otlier tangible fixed assets 4-15 years
10 Intangible fixed assets

11 Other assets
Costs of unjinished eapital construction
The cost of unfinished capital construction reflects the costs of procurement of fixed assets and upgrading of computer software tliat have not been completed. Depreciation is not charged for tlie cost of
unfinished capital construction during procurement and upgrades.
Other Assets
Other assets, except receivables from credit activities, are recognised at the principal cost minus risk provisions for on-balance sheet assets.
Provision for receivables is determined based on the overdue status of debts or expected loss of current debts. This provision is made when the debts are not yet due for payment, but the corporate debtors have
fallen into bankruptcy or are in the process of dissolution, or when individual debtors are missing, having escaped, are being prosecuted, on trial, or deceased. The provision expense incurred is recorded into
"Other operating expenses” of the year

period as follows:
Overdue Status Provision Rate
Over 6 months to less than 1 year 30%
From 1 to less than 2 years 50%
From 2 to less than 3 years 70%
3 years or more 100%
The risk provision for on-balance sheet assets is set aside for possible losses for unpaid debts detennined by the Bank after considering the recoverability of these debts.
12 Loan Sale Activities
Receivables from the sale of loan
Debts that have been sold but have not yet been collected are classified as assets with credit risks, recorded according to the actual sale amount not yet collected, and are classified as debts and set aside
provisions for credit risks in accordance with the provisions of Circular 31 and Decree 86
Revenue and loan selling expenses
Revenue and loan sale expenses are recorded in accordance with the guidance of Circular No. 09/2015/TT-NHNN dated July 17, 2015 of the State Bank of Vietnam regulating loan purchase and sale activities

- In case the selling price of the loan is higher than the book value of the loan, the higher difference shall be accounted into the Bank's income in the year;
- In case the selling price of the loan is lower than the book value of the loan, the lower difference shall be offset from the compensation of the individual or collective (in case the loss has been detennined to be
caused by the individual or collective and must be compensated according to regulations), the insurance money of the insurance organization and the risk reserve fund which have been set aside in the expenses,
the missing part shall be accounted into the Bank's expenses in tlie year

17 Other payables
Other payables are reflected in the original price
18 Provision
In addition to the provisions presented in other notes, a provision is recorded if, as a result of a past event, the Bank has a present or joint legal obligation that can be reliably estimated, and will certainly
diminish the future economic benefits of paying tlie liabilities due to tliat obligation. The provision is determined by discounting the cash flow expected to be paid in the future at a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects the market's current assessment of the time value of the money and the specific risk of that debt.
Provision for severance pay and unemployment insurance
According to the Labor Code of Vietnam, when an employee working for the Bank for 12 months or more ("eligible employee") voluntarily tenninates his/lier employment contract, the Bank must pay severance
pay to such employee based on the number of years of service and the average salary of the last six months at the time of termination of such employee. Prior to 2012, the severance allowance provision was
established on the basis of the number of years employees worked for the Bank and their average salary within six months prior to the end of the annual accounting period. For the purpose of determining tlie
number of years of working of employees, the time employees have participated in unemployment insurance as prescribed by law and tlie working time paid by tlie Bank for severance allowance are excluded.
On October 24, 2012, the Ministry of Finance issued Circular No. 180/2012/TT-BTC ("Circular 180") guiding tlie financial handling of unemployment allowances for employees at enterprises. This Circular
stipulates that when making financial statements in 2012, if tlie enterprise's unemployment allowance reserve fund has a balance, the enterprise must account for the increase in otlier income in 2012 and is not
allowed to transfer the fund balance to the next year for use. Accordingly, the Bank has refunded tlie balance of tlie severance allowance reserve. This change in accounting policy has been applied non-
retroactively since 2012
According to the Law on Social Insurance, from January' 1, 2009, the Bank and its employees must contribute to tlie unemployment insurance fund managed by the Vietnam Social Insurance. Unemployment
insurance paid by the Bank for the working time of employees is recorded in tlie expense in tlie separate statement of operating results when incurred.

tax profits according to the resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders and recorded in the Bank's liabilities. The appropriation rate shall be decided by tlie Bank's General Meeting of Shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.
20 Charter capital
Charter capital is the total par value of the shares sold. Common shares are recorded at par value. Expenses incurred directly related to the issuance of common shares are recorded as a deduction from equity.
21 .Mandatory Reserve Fund
According to Decree No. 93/2017/ND-CP issued by the Government of Vietnam on August 7, 2017 on financial regimes for credit institutions and tlie Law on Credit Institutions No. 32/2024/QH15 issued by
the National Assembly on January 18, 2024. Annually, the Bank must set aside the following compulsory reserve funds before distributing profits:
Annual appropriation rate Maximum Balance
Reserve fund to supplement charter capital 10% profit after tax 100% charter capital
Financial resen e fund 10% profit after tax Not regulated
The financial reserve fund shall be used to offset the remaining part of the losses and property damages incurred in the course of business after tliey have been offset by the indemnities of organizations and
individuals causing losses, of the insurance organization and use the provisions set aside in expenses; use for other purposes as prescribed by law. These mandatory reserve funds are not allowed to be
disti ibuted and are recorded as part of the equity
22 Potential commitments and Contingent liabilities
