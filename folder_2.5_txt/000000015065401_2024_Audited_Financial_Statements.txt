Responsibility of the Auditor
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted
our audit in accordance Vietnamese Standards on Auditing. However, due to the matter described in the
"Basis for disclaimer of opinion" paragraph, we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence
to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Basis for disclaimer of opinion
- As at 01 January 2024 and 31 December 2024, we did not participate in the physical count of cash of
VND 4,103,839 and VND 346,367,715, respectively; inventories of VND 40,293,473,911 and VND
40,245,566,597, respectively; and tangible fixed assets of VND 73,154,165,904 and VND
73,23 7,3 65,904, respectively. We were unable to perform alternative procedures, and therefore, we
cannot determine if adjustments are needed to the Company's cash balances and related items in the
financial statements for the financial year then ended.
- As mentioned in Note 7, section V on Inventories, the Company currently has finished goods stored in a
warehouse in the US with a value of VND 3 3,652,172,082 since 2006. We were unable to obtain

a value of VND 6,416,202,919 since 2013. We were also unable to perform procedures to verify the
completeness of the quantity or the basis for determining the value of these inventories as at 1 January

Basis for disclaimer of opinion (continued)
- As at 1 January 2024 and 31 December 2024, we were unable to obtain evidence to determine the
balances of the following accounts: Bank deposits of VND 724,081,864 and VND 541,265,167,
respectively; Trade receivables of VND 89,919,634,635 and VND 89,238,604,185, respectively (with
provisions of VND 88,914,692,199 and VND 89,167,000,551, respectively); Prepayments to suppliers
of VND 14,388,031,156 and VND 14,513,084,256, respectively (with provisions of VND
13,903,675,461 and VND 14,350,231,156, respectively); Other receivables of VND 14,858,028,098 and
VND 14,858,028,098, respectively (with provisions of VND 12,566,758,053 and VND 12,893,072,571,
respectively); Trade payables of VND 24,077,003,959 and VND 24,708,411,404, respectively; Short­
term borrowings of VND 433,655,543,222 and VND 439,727,506,730, respectively; Other short-term
payables of VND 978,784,654,204 and VND 1,047,375,051,814, respectively (including accrued
interest payables of VND 949,3 51,177,316 and VND 1,015,846,63 0,3 09, respectively); Other long-term
payables of VND 1,066,265,350 and VND 1,066,265,350, respectively. We were unable to perform ^
alternative audit procedures. Therefore, we cannot determine the existence, completeness of these
receivables and payables, provisions for doubtful receivables, interest expenses and related items in the
financial statements ended on the same date.
- In 2012, the Company conducted an appraisal to re-determine the enterprise value, resulting in an
increase of VND 111,337,014,296 compared to the book value, comprising increases in tangible and
intangible fixed assets of VND 12,745,043,314 and VND 98,591,970,982, respectively, and then used to
increase owner's equity by VND 102,000,000,000 and share premium by VND 9,337,014,296. However,
using an independent valuation service to revalue assets and recognizing the increase in total assets and
owners' equity is not in accordance with current Vietnamese accounting standards and regulations. By
2016, the Company retrospectively adjusted the entire additional asset value and recorded a decrease of
VND 111,337,014,296 in share premium, resulting in a negative share premium of VND
(25,797,520,000). Additionally, we were unable to obtain relevant documents related to the increase in
owner's equity (charter capital) in 2012 of VND 120,000,000,000 (VND 102,000,000,000 from share
premium and VND 18,000,000,000 from cash contribution). We were unable to perform alternative
procedures, therefore, we do not have sufficient basis to express an opinion on this capital increase and
related items in the Company's financial statements.
- As at 1 January 2024, we have not been provided with fixed asset records or the basis for estimating
accumulated depreciation at the beginning of the period. We were unable to perform alternative
procedures, therefore, we cannot determine whether adjustments are needed to the cost and accumulated
depreciation of fixed assets in the financial statements as at 1 January 2024, and 31 December 2024.
- In the financial year ended 31 December 2024, the Company continues suffering a loss of VND
(79,507,780,072) and the accumulated loss as at 31 December 2024, is VND (1,701,312,585,166),
resulting in negative owner's equity of VND (1,506,295,847,758). Additionally, as at 31 December
2024, current liabilities exceeded current assets by VND 1,510,886,742,231. These material factors
significantly impact the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

VIL FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES \
The risks from the financial instruments include market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. ^
The Board of Management considers the application of management policies for the
above risks as follows:
1. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to
changes in market prices. There are three market risks: interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other
price risks such as the risk of the stock price. Financial instruments affected by the market risks include
borrowings and liabilities, deposits, available-for-sale investments.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due
to changes in market prices. Market risks due to change in the interest rate of the Company mainly relate to
the borrowings and liabilities, cash and short-term deposits.
2. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument or customer contract will cause a financial loss
for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The Company bears credit risks from operating
activities (mainly trade receivables) and from its financial activities including bank deposits, foreign
exchange operations and other financial instruments.
Trade receivables
The Company minimizes the credit risk by only doing business with entities that have good financial
capacity and closely keeping track of the liabilities to speed up the recovery of debts. On the basis of this
method and receivables related to different customers, the credit risk does not concentrate on a certain
customer.
Bank deposits
The Company mainly maintains deposits in big and prestigious banks in Vietnam. The Company realized ,
that the concentration level of credit exposure to deposits is low.
The Board of Management of the Company evaluates that the majority of financial assets are current and
not impaired, as these financial assets are associated with reputable customers who have a good
creditworthiness.

3. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that arises from the difficulty in fulfilling financial obligations due to lack of
capital. The liquidity risk of the Company mainly arises from difference in maturity of the financial assets
and liabilities.
The Company supervises liquidity risk by maintaining an amount of cash, cash equivalents and borrowings
from banks at the level that the Board of Management considers as sufficient to satisfy the Company's
activities and minimize influences of changes in cash flows.
The payment term of financial liabilities based on expected contractual payments (on principal cash flow
basis) is as follows:

4. Financial assets and liabilities:
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is stated at the value that the financial instruments
are convertible in present transaction among partners, except for compulsory sale or disposal.
The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value:
The fair value of cash on hand and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other short-
term liabilities is equivalent to the book value of these items because these instruments are in short term. jh.
The fair value of securities and financial investments whose fair value cannot be reliably determined due to 1 H1
the absence of an active market with high liquidity for such securities and financial investments, are ^
presented at their book value. If
Except for the items mentioned above, the fair value of long-term financial assets and long-term financial
liabilities has not been formally assessed and determined as at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023.
However, the Company's Board of Management assesses that the fair value of these financial assets and
financial liabilities is not materially different from their book value at the end of the financial year.
