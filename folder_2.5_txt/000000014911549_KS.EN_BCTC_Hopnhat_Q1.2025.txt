the consolidated statement of profit or loss from the date of acquisition or until the date of
disposal of the investment in that subsidiary.
The parent company and subsidiaries use the same accounting policies and prepare financial
statements for the same accounting period, applying consistent accounting policies to similar
transactions and events under similar circumstances. In the case of differences in accounting
policies between the parent company and a subsidiary, the financial statements of the subsidiary
will be adjusted accordingly before being used for consolidation.
Balances in accounts on the consolidated balance sheet between companies within the group,
intercompany transactions, and unrealized intercompany profits arising from such transactions
must be fully eliminated. Unrealized losses arising from intercompany transactions are also
eliminated unless the cost resulting in the loss is not recoverable.
The interests of non-controlling shareholders represent the share of profits or losses in the net
assets of the subsidiary that is not held by the group and are presented as a separate line item in
the consolidated statement of profit or loss and on the consolidated balance sheet (under equity).
The interests of non-controlling shareholders include the value of their interests at the initial
consolidation date and their share of movements in equity since the business combination date.
Losses incurred by the subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interest in proportion to
their ownership interest, even when the loss exceeds the non-controlling interest’s share of the
subsidiary's net assets.
3. Foreign Currency Transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the exchange rate at the transaction date.
Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at the end of the financial year are translated
at the exchange rate on that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising during the year from foreign currency transactions are
recognized as financial income or financial expenses. Exchange differences from the revaluation
of foreign currency-denominated monetary items at the end of the financial year, after netting off
the increase and decrease differences, are recognized as financial income or financial expenses.
The exchange rate used for converting foreign currency transactions is the actual transaction rate
at the time of the transaction. The actual transaction exchange rate for foreign currency
transactions is determined as follows:
• For foreign currency purchase and sale contracts (spot contracts, forward contracts, futures
contracts, options contracts, swap contracts): the exchange rate stated in the foreign exchange
purchase or sale agreement between the group and the bank.
• For receivables: the foreign currency buying rate of the commercial bank where the group
designates the customer to make the payment at the time the transaction occurs.
• For payables: the foreign currency selling rate of the commercial bank where the group intends to
transact at the time the transaction occurs.
• For transactions involving the immediate purchase of assets or expenses paid in foreign currency
(not through accounts payable): the foreign currency buying rate of the commercial bank where the
group makes the payment.
The exchange rate used to revalue the balances of foreign currency-denominated monetary items
at the end of the financial year is determined as follows:
• For foreign currency deposits in banks: the foreign currency buying rate of the bank where the
group holds foreign currency accounts.

Loans are recognized at their original value, less provisions for doubtful receivables. Provisions for
doubtful receivables related to loans are made based on the estimated loss that may occur.
Investments in Associated Companies
An associated company is an entity in which the Group has significant influence but does not
control the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is evidenced by the ability to
participate in decisions regarding financial and operating policies of the investee, but without
controlling those policies.
Investments in associated companies are recognized using the equity method. Under this method,
the investment in an associated company is shown in the consolidated financial statements at the
initial investment cost, adjusted for changes in the Group's share of the investee’s net assets after
the investment date. If the Group's share of the associate’s losses exceeds or equals the carrying
value of the investment, the investment value is presented in the consolidated financial statements
as zero, unless the Group has obligations to make payments on behalf of the associated company.
The financial statements of the associated company are prepared for the same accounting period as
the Group's consolidated financial statements. When the accounting policies of the associated
company differ from the Group's consistent policies, appropriate adjustments are made to the
financial statements of the associated company before consolidation.
Unrealized gains or losses from transactions with associated companies are eliminated to the extent
of the Group's interest when preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Investments in Equity Instruments of Other Entities
Investments in equity instruments of other entities include investments in equity securities where
the Group does not have control, joint control, or significant influence over the investee.
Investments in equity instruments are initially recognized at cost, including the purchase price or
contribution amount, plus any directly attributable costs of the investment. Dividends from periods
before the investment was made reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Dividends from
periods after the investment is made are recognized as revenue. Dividends received in the form of
additional shares are only recorded as an increase in the number of shares, not as the value of the
shares received.

contribution of the parties in the other entity and the actual equity, multiplied by the Group’s share
of the total contributions in the other entity.
Any increase or decrease in the provision for impairment of investments in equity instruments at
the year-end is recognized as a financial expense.

taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that
taxable profits will be available in the future to utilize the temporary differences that can be
deducted.

reduced to the amount that is probable to be utilized based on available taxable profits. Deferred tax
assets that have not been recognized previously are reviewed at the end of the financial year and are

unrecognized deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities arc determined based on the tax rates expected to
apply in the year in which the asset is recovered or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates that
arc in effect at the end of the financial year. Deferred income tax is recognized in the profit and loss
statement and is directly recorded in equity only when the tax relates to items recognized directly in
equity.

2. Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its contractual obligations, resulting in a
financial loss for the Company.
The Company is exposed to credit risk from its business operations (mainly trade receivables) and
financial activities (bank deposits, loans, and other financial instruments).
3. Trade Receivables
The Company mitigates credit risk by dealing only with counterparties with good financial standing,
and its accounting staff regularly monitors receivables to expedite collections. Based on this
approach and the fact that the Company's receivables arc diversified among various customers,
credit risk is not concentrated in any single customer.
4. Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
due to changes in market prices.
Market risks related to the Company's operations include foreign exchange risk and interest rate
risk.
The sensitivity analyses presented below arc based on the net debt position, assuming that the ratio
between fixed-rate and floating-rate debt remains unchanged.
5. Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
'The Company's interest rate risk mainly relates to cash, short-term deposits, and borrowings.
The Company manages interest rate risk by analyzing market conditions to secure the most favorable
interest rates while remaining within its risk management limits.
The Company does not perform sensitivity analysis for interest rates because the risk from interest
rate fluctuations at the reporting date is considered insignificant.
