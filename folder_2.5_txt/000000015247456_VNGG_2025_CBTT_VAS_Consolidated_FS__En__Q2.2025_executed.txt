3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.1 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, cash in banks and short-term, highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of not more than three months that are readily
convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
3.2 Inventories
Inventories are measured at their historical costs. The cost of inventories comprise costs of
purchase, costs of conversion (including raw materials, direct labour cost, other directly
related cost, manufacturing general overheads allocated based on the normal operating
capacity) incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
In case the net realizable value is lower than the original price, it must be calculated according
to the net realizable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business
less the estimated costs to complete and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
The perpetual method is used to record tools and supplies, promotion goods, prepaid game
cards and merchandise, which are valued at cost of purchase on a weighted average basis.
Provision for obsolete inventories
An inventory provision is created for the estimated loss arising due to the impairment of value
(through diminution, damage, obsolescence, etc.) of tools and supplies, promotion goods,
prepaid game cards and merchandise owned by the Group, based on appropriate evidence
of impairment available at the consolidated balance sheet date.
Increases or decreases to the provision balance are recorded into the cost of goods sold
account in the consolidated income statement.
3.3 Receivables
Receivables are presented in the consolidated financial statements at the carrying amounts
due from customers and other debtors, after provision for doubtful debts.
The provision for doubtful debts represents amounts of outstanding receivables at the
consolidated balance sheet date which are doubtful of being recovered. Increases or
decreases to the provision balance are recorded as general and administrative expenses in
the consolidated income statement.
3.4 Prepaid expenses /
Prepaid expenses are reported either as short-term or long-term prepaid expenses in the x
consolidated balance sheet and amortised over the period for which the amounts are paid or ’/
the period in which economic benefits are generated in relation to these expenses.
Prepaid land rental
The prepaid land rental represents the unamortised balance of advance payment made in
accordance with the lease contracts signed with Tan Thuan Corporation No. 258/TTC-NV.13
dated 31 December 2013 and No. 078/TTC-NV.16 dated 27 April 2016 for a period until 23
September 2041, the lease contract No. 111/TTC-NV.20 dated 17 April 2020 for a period until
23 September 2041. Such prepaid rentals are recognised as long-term prepaid expenses for
allocation to the project cost or the consolidated income statement over the remaining lease

as at 30 June 2025 and for the six-month period then ended
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
3.5 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of a tangible fixed asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable
costs of bringing the tangible fixed asset to working condition for its intended use.
Expenditures for additions, improvements and renewals are added to the carrying amount of
the assets and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to the consolidated
income statement as incurred.
When tangible fixed assets are sold or retired, any gain or loss resulting from their disposal
(the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount) is included in the
consolidated income statement.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of each asset as follows:
Buildings and structures 5-25 years
Machinery and equipment 3-10 years
Transportations and transmission facilities 3 years
Office equipment 3-10 years
Others 2-5 years
Where parts of an item of tangible fixed assets have different useful lives, cost is allocated on
a reasonable basis among parts and each part is depreciated separately.
3.6 Leased assets
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the
substance of the arrangement at inception date and requires an assessment of whether the
fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset and the arrangement
conveys a right to use the asset.
A lease is classified as a finance lease whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially
all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the lessee. All other leases are classified
as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised in the consolidated balance sheet at the
inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased assets or, if lower, at the net present value
of the minimum lease payments. The principal amount included in future lease payments
under finance leases are recorded as a liability. The interest amounts included in lease
payments are charged to the consolidated income statement over the lease term to achieve
a constant rate on interest on the remaining balance of the finance lease liability.
Capitalised financial leased assets are depreciated using straight-line basis over the shorter
of the estimated useful live of the asset and the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty
that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the consolidated income statement on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

costs of preparing the intangible fixed asset for its intended use.
Expenditures for additions, improvements are added to the carrying amount of the assets and
other expenditures are charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred.

difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount) is included in the
consolidated income statement.
Software
Software is stated at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
estimated economic life and the license period.
Research and development costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure on an individual project
is recognized as an intangible asset only if the Group can demonstrate all of the following
conditions:
k The technical feasibility study of completing the intangible fixed asset so that it will be
available for use or sale;

is available for use.

phase and costs associated with repairs or maintenance of the existing websites and software

3.8 Construction in progress (continued)
Assets under construction

as the relevant assets are completed and put into use.
Construction in progress is not depreciated until such time the relevant assets are ready for
use.
3.9 Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of a
business combination is measured at the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued,
and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange plus any costs directly attributable
to the business combination. Identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair values at the date of business
combination.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost being the excess of
the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the
acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of a business
combination is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the
difference is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement. After initial recognition,
goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation. Goodwill is amortised over
a period of from eight (8) to ten (10) years on a straight-line basis.
3.10 Investments
Investments in associates
The Group’s investment in its associate is accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence that is
neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures.
Under the equity method, the investment is carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost
plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associates. Goodwill
arising on acquisition of the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment.
Goodwill is not amortised and subject to annual review for impairment.
The share of post-acquisition profit/(loss) of the associates is presented on face of the
consolidated income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is
recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the
carrying amount of the investment. Dividend/profit sharing received or receivable from
associates reduces the carrying amount of the investment.
The financial statements of the associates are prepared for the same reporting period and
use the same accounting policies as the Group. Where necessary, adjustments are made to
bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
Investments in other entities
Investments in other entities are stated at their acquisition costs.
Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments are stated at their acquisition costs. After initial recognition, held-
to-maturity investments are measured at recoverable amount. Any impairment loss incurred
is recognised as finance expense in the consolidated financial statements and deducted
against the value of such investments.

3.18 Revenue recognition (continued)
Revenue from online games (continued)
For online games, the Group’s identified performance obligation is to make the game and the
ongoing game-related services available to the gamers. Revenue is recognized when the
performance obligation was fulfilled. For purposes of determining the performance obligation
period, the Group has considered a number of factors including: the nature of each game, the
nature of virtual items sold, how the virtual items are sold and their importance to gamers.
On a quarterly basis, the Group estimates the average playing period of players for each
game based on churn rate using a broad range of data points across the three months of the
quarter. To compute the churn rate, the Group identifies the population of paying players who
make payment at the first month of each quarter and tracks player behaviour to determine the
subsequent churn rate of paying players, ie. the number of paying players who do not log in
to the game in the following two months of the quarter. The Group determines that a player
‘churns’ if it makes payment at the first month of the quarter but does not return to play the
game in the remaining months of that quarter. For some specific games, or when a new game
is launched and only a limited period of paying player data is available, the Group considers
other factors to determine the estimated playing period of players such as the estimated
playing period of players of other games with similar characteristics.
While the Group believes its estimates to be reasonable based on game player information
available at the time, the estimated average playing period may be revised if a game’s player
characteristics change. An adjustment to revenue arising from a change in estimate of the
average playing period in a given quarter is accounted for prospectively as a change in an
accounting estimate. Such a change is the result of new information on game player
behaviour patterns.
The Group offers many ways for users to pay for in-game virtual items, including ZaloPay
platform, bank transfers, credit cards, mobile phone billing, its own prepaid cards which are
sold through agents and other online payment gateways.
For revenue earned through mobile platforms, the transaction price is the gross amount that
the Group charges players as the Group is the principal in the transaction. The Group controls
the service of providing games to players and has a direct contractual arrangement with the
paying players. The related platforms and payment processing fees are recorded as cost of
revenues.
For revenue earned through other distribution channels (such as through agents, telcos and
online platforms), the Group is also the principal in the transaction. The Group recognizes "
revenue at the consideration received from the distributors. These distributors may choose to
alter the Group’s requested price by offering a discount or other incentives to players. The
Group does not receive information from these distributors indicating the amount of such .
discounts or incentives or the actual amount paid by players.
The Group recognizes channel costs as incremental costs, consistently with the pattern of
recognition of the respective revenues. For games where the factors indicate the overall
gaming experience and the virtual environment is more important to players than the virtual 3
items sold, channel cost is recognized over the estimated average playing period of players.
For games where the factors indicate the virtual items are more important to players than the
overall gaming experience, channel cost is recognized on a consistent basis with the
associated revenue.

3.20 Taxation (continued)
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance
sheet date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial
reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
> where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in
a transaction which at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor
taxable profit or loss; and
> in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries
and associates where timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled
and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward
unused tax credit and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit
will be available against which deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax
credit and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:
k where the deferred tax asset in respect of deductible temporary difference which arises
from the initial recognition of an asset or liability which at the time of the related
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
i - in respect of deductible temporarily differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries and associates, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it
is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available
to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Previously unrecognised deferred
tax assets are re-assessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that
it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax assets to be
recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in
the period when the asset is realised, or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws
that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except when it
relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with
in equity account.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right for the
Group to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income
taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity; or when the
Group intends either settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or to realise the
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant
amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.
