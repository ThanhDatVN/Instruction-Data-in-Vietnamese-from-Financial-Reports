Consolidated Financial Statement Notes (Continued)
I* Quarter of2025, Financial Year Ending March 31, 2025
2. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of the Parent Company
and its Subsidiaries
Subsidiary
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control over their financial policies and operational
activities. The financial statements of tliese Subsidiaries have been prepared for the same financial period as
the Parent Company, applying accounting policies consistent with the Parent Company's accounting policies.
Adjusting entries have been made for any accounting policies with differences to ensure consistency between
the Subsidiaries and the Parent Company.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealized profits from intercompany transactions,
have been fully eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, except
when the cost is not recoverable. The interest of non-control ling shareholders represents the portion of
profits or losses and net assets not held by the Group's shareholders and is presented separately in the
consolidated income statement and the consolidated balance sheet.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the Parent Company obtains control and will cease to be
consolidated from the date the Parent Company loses control over the Subsidiary. In the case where the
Parent Company no longer has control over the Subsidiaries, the consolidated financial statements will
include the results of operations for the period during which the Parent Company still had control.
The financial statements of Subsidiaries subject to joint control business consolidation are included in the
Parent Company’s consolidated financial statements using the equity method. The financial statements of
other Subsidiaries are consolidated into the Parent Company’s financial statements using the acquisition
method, whereby assets and liabilities arc recognized at fair value as of the date of business combination.
Associate
An Associate refers to any entity over which the Group has significant influence but does not control,
typically reflected by holding between 20% and 50% of the voting rights in the entity. ^
The Group has applied the equity method to present its investment in associates when preparing these /
consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of income ?f ■
and expenses of the associates, accounted for under the equity method, after adjustments in line with the
Group's accounting policies, from the date significant influence begins until the date such influence ends. >
When the Group’s share of losses in an associate exceeds the Group’s interest in the associate, as accounted
for under the equity method, the carrying amount of the investment (including long-term investments, if any)
is written down to zero, and no further losses are recognized, unless the Group has an obligation to pay or
has already paid on behalf of the associate
3. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand, demand deposits at banks, cash in transit, and monetary gold.
Cash equivalents are short-term investments with a maturity or redemption period of no more than three
months from the date of purchase, which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value.
4. Financial investments
Trading securities
Trading securities are classified as such when held for the purpose of resale to earn a profit.
Trading securities are recorded in the accounting books at cost. The cost of trading securities is determined
based on the fair value of the consideration paid at the transaction date plus any directly attributable
transaction costs.
The recognition time of trading securities is when the Company gains ownership rights, specifically as
follows:

- For unlisted securities: recognized at the time when ownership rights are legally transferred in accordance
with applicable regulations.
Interest, dividends, and profits relating to periods prior to the acquisition of the trading securities are
deducted from the cost of those securities. Interest, dividends, and profits relating to periods after the
acquisition are recorded as financial income. Dividends received in the form of shares are tracked by the
increased number of shares only, without recognizing any value for the received shares.
Provision for the devaluation of trading securities is made for each type of security that is traded on the
market and has a market price lower than its cost. The fair value of listed trading securities on the stock
exchange or traded on UPCOM is the closing price on the financial reporting date. If no transaction occurs
on the stock market or UPCOM on the reporting date, the fair value is based on the closing price of the
nearest trading session prior to the reporting date.
Any increase or decrease in the provision for devaluation of trading securities as of the financial reporting
date shall be recorded as financial expenses
Loans
Receivables from loans are presented in the financial statements at their original cost, less an allowance for
doubtful debts.
The allowance for doubtful debts reflects the estimated loss in value at the end of the reporting period for
loans that are overdue, have been repeatedly pursued but remain uncollected, or are not yet due but the
borrower is in a state of bankruptcy, undergoing liquidation procedures, missing, or has fled.

and profits from periods prior to the acquisition of the investment are deducted from the carrying amount of W
the investment. Dividends and profits from periods after the acquisition are recognized as revenue. Stock w
dividends are only tracked in terms of the increase in the number of shares and are not recognized as the
value of the shares received.
Impairment of investments in equity instruments of other entities is made as follows:
For investments in listed shares or where the fair value of the investment can be reliably determined,
the impairment is based on the market value of the shares.
For investments where the fair value cannot be reliably determined at the reporting date, the
impairment is based on the loss of the invested entity. The impairment is calculated as the difference
between the actual contributions made by the parties to the other entity and the actual equity,
multiplied by the Company’s ownership percentage in the other entity relative to the total capital
confributed by all parties.
Any increase or decrease in the impairment of investments in equity instruments of other entities as of the
end of the financial year is recognized as a financial expense được ghi nhận into Financial expenses.

incurred to bring the inventory to its current location and condition.

directly attributable and allocated based on normal production levels.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of the inventory in the ordinary course of business, less
estimated costs to complete and estimated costs to sell it.
The value of inventory is calculated using the weighted average cost method and is accounted for using the
perpetual inventory method.
An allowance for inventory impairment is made for each item of inventory where the cost exceeds the net
realizable value. For services in progress, the impairment allowance is calculated for each type of service
based on its specific price. Any increase or decrease in the allowance for inventory impairment that needs to
be recognized as of the end of the financial year is recorded as part of cost of goods sold

removed from the books, and the gain or loss from disposal is recognized in the income or expenses of the

14. COGS
COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) is the total cost of goods or services provided, including other expenses
allocated to the cost of goods sold or any deductions reducing COGS.
15. Financial expenses
Financial expenses are costs related to financial activities, including expenses or losses associated with
financial investments, lending and borrowing activities, and capital contributions to joint ventures or
associates.
Borrowing costs include interest on loans and other expenses directly related to borrowings. If borrowing
costs are directly associated with the investment, construction, or production of qualifying assets under
development that require a significant period (over 12 months) to become operational or ready for sale, such
costs are capitalized. For loans specifically taken for the construction of fixed assets or investment
properties, interest is capitalized even if the construction period is less than 12 months. Income earned from
the temporary investment of such loans is deducted from the original cost of the related asset.
For general borrowings used partially for the purpose of constructing or producing qualifying assets under
development, the capitalized borrowing costs are determined based on a capitalization rate applied to the
weighted average cumulative costs incurred for the construction or production of those assets. The
capitalization rate is calculated based on the weighted average interest rate of all outstanding borrowings
during the period, excluding loans that are specifically allocated for the purpose of creating a particular asset.
16. Selling expenses and Administrative expenses
Selling expenses and Administrative expenses are all costs incurred in the process of selling products, goods,
providing services, and the general management expenses of the Group.
17. Tax and amounts payable to the State
Taxes the Group calculates and pays to the Budget include:
VAT

well as adjustments for tax-exempt income and carryforward losses
Corporate income tax rate: 20%.
Other types of taxes, according to current regulations at the time of annual tax payment. MN
18. Related party
Parties are considered related if one party has the ability to control or exert significant influence over the ^z
other party in making decisions about financial and operating policies. Parties are also considered related if
they are under common control or significant common influence.
In assessing the relationship of related parties, the substance of the relationship is given more emphasis than
its legal form.
19. Reporting by Segment

manufacturing or providing products or services, and has risks and economic benefits that are different from
those of other business segments.
