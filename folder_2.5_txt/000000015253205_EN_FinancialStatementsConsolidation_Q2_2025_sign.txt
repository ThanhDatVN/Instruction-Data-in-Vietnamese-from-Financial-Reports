3. ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS
3.1. Accounting systems
The Group applies Vietnamese Accounting Standards and Regulations
3.2. Declaration of compliance with Accounting Standards and Accounting Regime
The Group complies with Vietnamese Accounting Standards and Systems to prepare and present the
consolidated financial statements for the accounting period ending 30 June 2025.
4. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
4.1. Foreign currencies
0 The exchange rates applicable in accounting are as follows:
Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam;
Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade;
Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam.
■ The exchange rate applicable to asset recognition and re-evaluation is the foreign currency-buying
rate;
■ The exchange rate applicable to liability recognition and re-evaluation is the foreign currency­
selling rate.
■ Exchange rates applicable to the other transactions are the foreign currency-buying rate.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded, on initial recognition, in the reporting currency, by
applying to the foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the reporting currency and the
foreign currency at the date of the transaction. The exchange differences arising on the settlement of
monetary items are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. At the end of the reporting
year, monetary items excluding advances to suppliers, prepaid expenses, and unearned revenues,
which are denominated in foreign currency, are reported using the closing rate and resultant exchange
differences resulting from the reporting after offset are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which
they arise.
4.2. Use of estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that impact the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, contingent assets and
liabilities reported in the notes at 30 June 2025 as well as revenues and expenses in the consolidated
financial statements for the financial year ended 30 June 2025. Although these estimates are based on
management’s best knowledge of all relevant information available at the date when the consolidated
financial statements are prepared, this does not prevent actual figures differing from estimates.
4.3. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, cash in transit and current investments
for a period not exceeding 3 months or highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash equivalents are defined the same as those under Accounting Standard "Statement ofcash flows.”

4.4. Held to maturity investments
Held to maturity investments comprise term deposits,
If there is any certain evidence that part or all the investments are irrecoverable, impairment losses are
recognised as a finance expense in the current year.
4.5. Account receivables
Recognition method
Account receivables are stated at the carrying amounts of trade receivables and other receivables less
provisions for doubtful debts.
Provisions for doubtful debts
As of the date of the consolidated financial statements, provisions for doubtful debts are recognised for
past-due accounts receivable and for accounts receivable where circumstances indicate that they might
be uncollectible or for uncollectible debts due to liquidation, bankruptcy, or similar difficulties.
The difference between the required balance and the existing balance of provisions for doubtful debts
is recorded as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated income statement.
4.6. Inventories
Inventory measurement
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The costs of inventories shall comprise all costs of purchase, costs of conversion, and other costs
incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. Cost in the case of finished goods
and work in progress includes raw materials, direct labour, and attributable manufacturing overheads.
The costs of purchase comprise the purchase price, non-reimbursable taxes and duties, and transport,
handling, and other costs directly attributable to the purchase. Trade discounts and sales rebates on
substandard and obsolete goods purchased are deducted from the costs of purchase.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated
costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Method of accounting for inventories
Inventories are measured using the weighted average method and are recorded under the perpetual
inventory method.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Provisions for decline in value of inventories
As of the date of the consolidated financial statements, provisions are recognised for obsolete, slow-
moving, defective inventory, and for inventory stated at cost higher than net realisable value.
The difference between the required balance and the existing balance of the provisions for a decline in
value of inventories is included in cost of sales in the consolidated income statement.
Inventories are written down to net realizable value on an item-by-item basis. For services being
rendered, provision is made in respect of each service for which a separate selling price will be charged.
Materials and other supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below
cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost.
4.7. Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Tangible fixed asset recognition
Tangible fixed assets are initially recognised at their cost. The cost of purchased tangible fixed assets
comprises the purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the assets to their present
location and working condition for their intended use. Accessories added to fixed assets when
purchased are recognised separately at their fair value and deducted from the historical cost of the
respective tangible fixed assets.
The costs of tangible fixed assets constructed by contractors are the finalised costs of the construction,
other directly related expenses and the registration fee (if any).
Depreciation and amortisation
The costs of fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Year 2025
Buildings, structures 03 - 25 years
Machinery and equipment 02-16 years
Motor vehicles 03-12 years
Office equipment 03 - 05 years
Perennials and other tangible fixed assets 03 - 07 years
4.8. Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization.
Intangible fixed asset recognition
The cost of an intangible fixed asset comprises the total amount of expense incurred by the Group to
acquire an asset at the time the asset is put into operation for its intended use.

asset and depreciated over its useful life.
4.9. Construction in progress
Properties in the course of construction for production, rental, or administrative purposes, or for purposes
not yet determined, are carried at cost. Cost includes professional fees, and for qualifying assets,
borrowing costs dealt with in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these
assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their
intended use.
4.10. Prepayments
Prepayments are classified as current and non-current based on their original term. Prepayments mainly
comprise cost of compensating, licence of mining, tool and supplies, land rentals, etc. which are
amortised over the period for which they are paid or the period in which economic benefits are generated

■ Costs of compensation and mining licence are amortised over the mining period from 04 to 21
years;

following rules: Trade payables represent those arising from purchase and sale related transactions of
goods, services or assets and the seller is independent of the buyer; intra-company payables represent
those between the entity and its dependent accounting units having no legal status; the remaining
payables are classified as other payables.
Liabilities are also classified according to the maturity date, the remaining term from the date of the
consolidated financial statements, original currency, and each creditor.
Liabilities are recognised at no less than the payment obligation.
4.12. Borrowing costs
Capitalisation of borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets,
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are
capitalised as part of the cost of those assets until the assets are put into use or sale,
Investment income earned on temporary investment of borrowings is deducted from the cost of the
respective assets.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement when
incurred.
4.13. Accrued expenses and Provision
Accrued expenses
Accrued expenses represent expenses that will be paid in the future for goods or services received but
not yet paid due to lack of invoices or accounting documents. These expenses are recognised as
operating expenses of the reporting year.
Provisions
A provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a
past event; a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation; and it is probable that an
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions
shall not be recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. If the time
value of money is material, provisions will be measured at their present value using a pre-tax rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.

Annual General Meeting of Shareholders and reserves are created in accordance with the Group’s
Charter and legal regulations in Vietnam.
4.15. Revenue and other income
Revenue from selling goods
Revenue from selling goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. In
most cases, revenue is recognised when transferring the risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer
Revenue involving the rendering of services
Revenue of a transaction involving the rendering of services is recognised when the outcome of this
transaction can be estimated reliably. When a transaction involving the rendering of services is
attributable to several periods, each period’s revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of
completion at the end of the reporting period.
Revenue from construction contracts
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the accounting policy on
construction contracts as Note 3.19 below

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
decreases in revenue of the reporting year; Deductions arising after the end of the reporting year and
after issuing the consolidated financial statements for the reporting year are recognised as decreases in
revenue of the next year.
4.17. Construction contracts
Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the date of the consolidated
statement of financial position as measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work
performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs - except where this would not be
representative of the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments
are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be reliably estimated, no profit will be recognized,
even when the total contract performance costs may exceed the total contract revenue.
4.18. Cost of sales
Cost of sales and services provided represents total costs of finished products, goods, services, which
are sold in the year in accordance with the matching principle. Abnormal amounts of production costs
of inventories are recognised immediately in cost of sales.

income tax (CIT) of the current year at 20%.
Deferred corporate income tax expense
Deferred corporate tax expense is determined on the basis of the deductible temporary differences,
taxable temporary differences and the estimated CIT rate that will be applied for the years that assets

and liabilities will be recovered. The tax rates used will be the tax rates (and tax laws) that are in effect
at the financial year end.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable
that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised,
unless:
■ The deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which
at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss).
■ The deferred tax assets for all deductible temporary differences associated with investments in
subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint ventures are only recognised when it
is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future; and taxable profit
will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset shall be reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit
of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilised. Any such reduction shall be reverted to the extent
it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.
Value added tax
The goods sold and services rendered by the Group are subject to value added tax at the following
rates:
B Import: 0%
■ Domestic consumption: 10%.
Other taxes
Other taxes are applicable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in Vietnam.
The tax reports of the companies in the Group will be inspected by the Tax Department. Application of
the laws and regulations on tax to different transactions can be interpreted by many ways; therefore, the
tax amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements can be amended in accordance with the
Tax Department's final assessment for the companies.
4.22, Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders
(after adjusted for bonus and welfare funds), by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding during the year, excluding ordinary shares bought back by the Group and held as treasury
shares.
4.23. Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders
(after adjusted for bonus and welfare funds), by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
outstanding during the year and total ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion, excluding
ordinary shares bought back by the Group and held as treasury shares.
4.24. Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in producing or providing
related products or services (business segment), or in producing or providing products or services within
a particular economic environment (geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
are different from those of other segments.
4.25. Principles of preparing consolidated financial statements
Consolidated financial statements are financial statements of the Group in which the assets, liabilities,
capital, revenue, expenses, and cash flows of the parent company and its subsidiaries are presented
as a single enterprise, established without regard to the legal boundaries of individual companies. The
financial statements of the subsidiaries have been prepared for the same fiscal year as the parent
company, under accounting policies consistent with the parent company's accounting policies. Adjusting
entries were made for any discrepancies in accounting policies to ensure consistency between
subsidiaries and the parent company.
Method of Recognizing Non-Controlling Interests
Non-controlling interests in the net income and net assets of a subsidiary are presented separately in
the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet.
Losses incurred by the subsidiary are allocated proportionately to the non-controlling interests, even if
such losses exceed the non-controlling interests' share in the subsidiary's net assets.
Method of Eliminating Internal Transactions
All internal balances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from internal transactions, are
completely eliminated upon consolidation. Unrealized losses are also eliminated in the consolidated
financial statements, except when the cost causing the loss cannot be recovered.
Method of Determining Goodwill
At the time of gaining control of a subsidiary, goodwill is determined as the difference between the cost
of the investment and the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary at the acquisition date
held by the parent company. Goodwill is presented as a separate item in the consolidated financial
statements and is amortized evenly over a period not exceeding 10 years as an expense in the
consolidated income statement.
4.26. Related parties
Related parties are individuals or entities that have the ability, directly or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, to control the Group or are controlled by, or are subject to common control with the
Group. Associates, individuals owning, directly or indirectly, an interest in the voting power of the Group
that gives them significant influence over the Group, key management personnel, including directors
and officers of the Group and close family members or associates of such individuals are also
considered to be related parties.
