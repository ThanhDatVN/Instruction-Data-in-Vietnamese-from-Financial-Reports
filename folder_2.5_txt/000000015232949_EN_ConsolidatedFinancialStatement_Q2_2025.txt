'J
2. Consolidation basis
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Financial Statements of the Holding Company /
and the Financial Statements of its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is a business that is controlled by the :^
Holding Company. The control exists when the Holding Company has the power to directly or
indirectly govern the financial and operating policies of the subsidiary to obtain economic benefits
from its activities. In determining the control power, the potential voting right that is currently valid
or will be transferred should also be taken into consideration as of the balance sheet date.
The business results of the subsidiaries which arc acquired or disposed during the year arc included
in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition until the date of disposal of the
investments in those subsidiaries.
The Financial Statements of the Holding Company and subsidiaries used for consolidation are
prepared for the same accounting period and apply the consistent accounting policies for similar
transactions and events in similar circumstances. In case that the accounting policies of the
subsidiaries are different from those which are applied consistently within the Group, the
appropriate adjustments should be made to the Financial Statements of the subsidiaries before they
are used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Intra-group balances in the balance sheet and intra-group transactions and unrealized intra-group
profits resulting from these transactions are eliminated when the Consolidated Financial Statements
are prepared. Unrealized losses resulting from intra-group transactions arc also eliminated unless
costs which cause those losses cannot be recovered.
Interest of non-controlling shareholders shows gains/losses on the business results and net assets of
a subsidiary which is not held by of the Group and is presented in a specific item in the
Consolidated Income Statement and the Consolidated Balance Sheet (the owner’s equity). Interest
of non-controlling shareholders includes value of non-controlling minority interest as of the initial
business consolidation date and that in the fluctuation of owner’s equity commencing from the
business consolidation date. Losses arising in subsidiaries are allocated equivalent to the ownership
rate of non-controlling shareholders, even if those losses are higher than the ownership rate of non­
controlling shareholders in net assets of subsidiaries.
3. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term investments of
which the , due dates cannot exceed 3 months from the dates of the investments and the
convertibility into cash is easy, and which do not have a lot of risks in the conversion into cash as

• For shares registered for transactions on the transaction market of the unlisted public
companies and the state-owned enterprises equitized under the form of selling stocks to the
public (UPCom): the average reference price in the last 30 consecutive transaction days before
the balance sheet date disclosed by the Stock Exchange.
• For shares listed on the stock market or shares of joint stock companies registered for trading
on UPCom market which have no transaction within 30 days prior to the date of provision
extraction, listed shares which have been delisted, suspended or stopped from trading:
provision is made based on the loss of the invested Group equal to the difference between the

contributed.

investments, the value of investments will be presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as
zero unless the Group has an obligation to make the payment instead of associates.

increase in value, but the increasing quantity of shares is followed up.
Provision for impairment of investments in equity instruments of other entities is made as follows:
• For investments in listed shares or fair value of investments which is reliably measured,
provision is made on the basis of the market value of shares.
• For investments of which the fair value cannot be measured at the time of reporting,
provision is made on the basis of the losses suffered by investees, at the rate equal to the
difference between the actual capital invested by investors and the actual owner’s equity
multiplying (x) by the Group’s rate of charter capital in these investees.
Increases/ (decreases) in the provision for impairment of investments in equity instruments of other
entities are recorded into “Financial expenses” during the year.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (cont.)
• The Group received or shall probably receive the economic benefits associated with the
rendering of services;
• The stage of completion of the transaction at the end of reporting period can be measured
reliably; and
• The costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be
measured reliably.
Income from leasing operating assets
Income from leasing operating assets is recognized in accordance with the straight-line method
during the lease term.
In case, the leasing duration holds over 90% of the assets’ useful lives, sales shall be once recognized
for the whole leasing amount received in advance when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
• The lessees have no right to cancel the lease contracts and the Group is not obliged to return
the money received in advance in any case and in any form.
V,
• The amount received in advance from leasing is not less than 90% of total estimated rental !V

• Costs related to leasing operation can be rather adequately estimated.
Interest
Interest is recorded, based on the term and the actual interest rate applied in each particular period.
15. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are interests and other costs that the Group directly incurs in connection with the
borrowings.
Borrowing costs are recorded as expenses when they are incurred. In case the borrowing costs are
directly attributable to the construction or the production of an asset in progress, which takes a
substantial period of time (over 12 months) to get ready for intended use or sales of the asset, these
costs will be included in the cost of that asset. To the extent that the borrowings arc especially for
the purpose of construction of fixed assets and investment properties, the borrowing cost is eligible
for capitalization even if construction period is under 12 months. Incomes arisen from provisional
investments as loans are recognized as a decrease in the costs of relevant assets.
In the event that general borrowings are partly used for the acquisition, construction or production of an
asset in progress, the costs eligible for capitalization will be determined by applying the capitalization
rate to average accumulated expenditure on construction or production of that asset. The capitalization
rate is computed at the weighted average interest rate of the borrowings not yet paid during the period,
except for particular borrowings serving the purpose of obtaining a specific asset.
16. Expenses
Expenses are those that result in outflows of the Group’s economic benefits and are recorded at the
time of transactions or when incurrence of the transaction is reliable regardless of whether payment
for expenses is made or not.
Expenses and their corresponding revenues are simultaneously recognized in accordance with
matching principle. In the event that matching principle conflicts with prudence principle, expenses
are recognized based on the nature and regulations of accounting standards in order to guarantee
that transactions can be fairly and truly reflected.

17. Corporate income tax
Corporate income tax includes current income tax and deferred income tax.
Current income tax
Current income tax is the tax amount computed based on the taxable income. Taxable income is
different from accounting profit due to the adjustments of temporary differences between tax and
accounting figures, non-deductible expenses as well as those of non-taxable income and losses
brought forward.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is the amount of corporate income tax payable or refundable due to temporary
differences between book values of assets and liabilities serving the preparation of the financial
statements and the values for tax purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all the
temporary taxable differences. Deferred income tax assets are recorded only when there is an
assurance on the availability of taxable income in the future against which the temporarily ry
deductible differences can be used. 4
A
Book value of deferred corporate income tax assets is considered as of the balance sheet date and
will be reduced to the rate that ensures enough taxable income against which the benefits from part
of or all of the deferred income tax can be used. Deferred corporate income tax assets, which have
not been recorded before, are considered as of the balance sheet date and are recorded when there
is certainly enough taxable income to use these unrecognized deferred corporate income tax assets.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are determined at the estimated rate
to be applied in the year when the assets are recovered or the liabilities are settled based on the
effective tax rates as of the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax is recognized in the income
statement. In the case that deferred income tax is related to the items of the owner’s equity,
corporate income tax will be included in the owner’s equity.
The Group shall offset deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if, and only if:
• The Group has the legal right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax
liabilities; and
• Defen'ed income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are relevant to corporate income
tax which is under the management of one tax authority either:
Of the same subject to corporate income tax; or
The Group has intention to pay current income tax liabilities and current income tax assets
on a net basis or recover tax assets and settle tax liability simultaneously in each future
period to the extent that the majority of deferred income tax liabilities or deferred income
tax assets are paid or recovered.
18. Related parties
A party is considered a related party of the Group in case that party is able to control the Group or
to cause material effects on the financial decisions as well as the operations of the Group. A party
is also considered a related party of the Group in case that party is under the same control or is
subject to the same material effects.
Considering the relationship of related parties, the nature of relationship is focused more than its
