13. Objectives and policies for financial risk management
The main risks from financial instruments include market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board of General Directors reviews and applies management policies for the above risks as follows:
13.1 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate With changes in
market prices. There are three types of market risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as stock
price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include deposits, available-for-sale investments, loans and debts.
The sensitivity analyses presented below relate to the Company's financial position as at 30/06/2025 compared to the
same period last year.
These sensitivity analyses have been prepared on the basis that the value of net debt, the ratio of fixed-rate debt to
floating-rate debt and the correlation ratio between foreign currency-denominated financial instruments are constant.
When calculating the sensitivity analysis, the Board of Management assumes that the sensitivity of the avabbte-for-sale
debt instruments on the balance sheet and related items in the income statement is affected by changes in relevant
market risk assumptions. This analysis is based on the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities held as at
30/06/20.25 compared to the same period is the previous year.
Merest rate risk '
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes, in market interest rates. Market risks due to changes in the Company's interest rates are mainly related to the
Company's loans, debt, and cash.
The Company manages interest rate risk by analyzing the competitive situation in the market to obtain interest rates that
tire beneficial for the Company’s purposes and remain within its risk management limits.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Far Q2D025 Unit: Vietnam Dong
13.1 Market risk (continue)
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity of the Company's loans and liabilities, cash to reasonably possible changes in interest rates is presented
as follows.
With the assumption that other variables remain unchanged, fluctuations in interest rates on loans and debt with floating
interest rates affect the Company’s pre-tax profit as follows:
bweasri Decrease Impact on pre-tax
basis peint profit
This year
VND + 100 325.797.228
VND -100 (325.797.228)
Last year
VND +100 (228.565.296)
VND -100 228.565.296
The basis point increases/decreases used for the interest rate sensitivity analysis are assumed based on current
observable market conditions, which indicate that volatility is not significantly higher than in previous periods.
Raw material costs (mainly roll paper, cardboard) and printing costs are two costs that account for a large proportion of
total production costs. Therefore, changes in the prices of raw materials as well as services will greatly affect the cost of
finished products. The Company believes that the risk of raw material prices and printing costs tn production and
* business activities is high. In order to ensure the stability of finished product prices, the Company's production
management department regularly monitors fluctuations in raw material prices as well as printing costs and proposes
) solutions to the General Director. Reserve raw materials as well as appropriate production and business plans.
< Price risk of (ratling securities
i . Trading securities held by the Company are affected by market risks arising from uncertainty regarding the future value
of trading securities. Tire Company manages price risk by establishing investment limits. The Board of Directos of the
Company also reviews and approves investment decisions in trading securities.

4.237.145.000 (VND 4.237.145.000 as of January1 I, 2025). If the price of these shares decreases by 10%, the
Company’s pre-tax profit will decrease by approximately VND 423.714.500. If the price of these shares increases by
10%, the Company's pre-tax profit will increase by approximately VND 423.714.500.
13.2 Cretilt risk

financial loss. Die Company has credit risk from its production and business activities (mainly for accounts receivable
from customers) and from its financial activities, including bank deposits, foreign exchange operations and other
financial instruments.

customer’s credit quality at the reporting date for deterioration. The Company seeks to maintain tight control over
outstanding receivables and staff credit controls to minimize credit risk.

concentration of credit risk from bank deposits is low.
13.3 Liquidity risk

maturities,
The Company monitors liquidity risk by maintaining a level ofcash and cash equivalents and bank loans that the Board
of General Directors considers sufficient to meet the Company's operations and to minimize the impact of cash flow
fluctuations.

The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate fair value:
The fair value of cash and short-term deposits, receivables from customers, payables to suppliers and other short-term
liabilities is equivalent to the carrying amount of these items because these instruments have short: maturities.
The fair value of listed securities and financial debt instruments is determined at market value. For unlisted securities
investments (hat are frequently traded, the fair value is determined as the average price provided by three independent
securities companies at the end of the financial, year.
The fair value of securities and financial investments whose fair value cannot be determined with certainty due to the
lack of a highly liquid market for these securities and financial investments is presented at book value.
Except for the items mention«! above, the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities has not been officially
evaluated and determined as of June 30,2025 and January 1,2025. However, Board of General Directors assesses that
the fair value of these financial assets and financial liabilities does not differ materially from the carrying value at the
end of the financial period.
