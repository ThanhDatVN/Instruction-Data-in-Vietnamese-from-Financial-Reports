separate financial statements to meet the prevailing requirements in relation to disclosure of
information, specifically the Circular No. 96/2020/TT-BTC on disclosure of information on the

2.2 Going concern assumption
As at 31 December 2024, the Company’s accumulated losses amounted to VND
3,188,409,199,028. The Company’s General Director has prepared profit and cash flow
projections for the next 12 months from the date of the separate financial statements to ensure
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These projections have been prepared
based on continuing to improve business operations by increasing the export of furniture
products to foreign markets and simultaneously increasing orders from large projects of both
domestic and foreign partners. In addition, the Company has arranged additional funding from
loans provided by commercial banks to meet its working capital requirements. Based on these
factors, the Company’s General Director believes that it is appropriate to prepare the
Company’s separate financial statements on a going concern basis.
Accordingly, the separate financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be
necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
