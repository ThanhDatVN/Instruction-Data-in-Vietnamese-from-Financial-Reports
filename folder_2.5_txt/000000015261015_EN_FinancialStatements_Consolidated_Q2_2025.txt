that the book value of these securities does not exceed their book value assuming that no provisions have been recorded.

decrease in securities prices, specifically as follows:

contributed charter capital (%) at the economic organization receiving the contributed capital at the end of the accounting period.

and overhaul expenses shall be recorded in the statement of results of business activities in the year in which the expenses are incurred. In cases where it can be clearly demonstrated that these costs increase
the anticipated future economic benefit derived from the use of tangible fixed assets in excess of the standard operating level as originally assessed, these costs are capitalized as an additional cost of the fixed
asset form.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of the tangible fixed asset. The estimated useful life is as follows:
• houses, architectural objects 5-50
• management equipment and instruments 3 - 8 years
• means of transport 6-10 years
• other tangible fixed assets 4-15 years

reflects the market's current assessment of the time value of the money and the specific risk of that debt.
Provision for severance pay and unemployment insurance
According to the Labor Code of Vietnam, when an employee working for the Bank for 12 months or more ("eligible employee") voluntarily terminates his/her employment contract, the Bank must pay
severance pay to such employee based on the number of years of service and the average salary of the last six months at the time of termination of such employee. Prior to 2012, the severance allowance
provision was established on the basis of the number of years employees worked for the Bank and their average salary within six months prior to tlie end of the annual accounting period. For the purpose of
determining the number of years of working of employees, the time employees have participated in unemployment insurance as prescribed by law and the working time paid by the Bank for severance
allowance are excluded.
On October 24, 2012, the Ministry of Finance issued Circular No. 180/2012/TT-BTC ("Circular 180") guiding the financial handling of unemployment allowances for employees at enterprises. This Circular
stipulates that when making financial statements in 2012, if the enterprise's unemployment allowance reserve fund has a balance, the enterprise must account for the increase in other income in 2012 and is not
allowed to transfer the fund balance to the next year for use. Accordingly, the Bank has refunded the balance of the severance allowance reserve. This change in accounting policy has been applied non-
retroactively since 2012
According to the Law on Social Insurance, from January 1, 2009, the Bank and its employees must contribute to the unemployment insurance fund managed by the Viemarn Social Insurance. Unemployment
