The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is reflected at the amount at which the financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.
The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate fair value:
- The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans, other receivables, borrowings,
payables to suppliers, employees, convertible shares and other short-term payables is equivalent to the
book value (less the provision for the estimated uncollectible portion) of these items due to their short
maturity.
- The fair value of available-for-sale financial assets listed on the stock market is the published transaction
price at the end of the accounting period. The Company has not yet conducted an official valuation of
unlisted available-for-sale financial assets. However, the Chairman assessed that the fair value of these
financial assets is not materially different from the carrying value.

06 . The Company's risk management objectives and policies
a. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a party to a financial instrument or transaction contract will not meet its
obligations, leading to a financial loss to the Company.
The Company is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and >
financing activities (bank deposits and other financial instruments). V
n
- Accounts receivable
C
The Company minimizes credit risk by only dealing with financially sound entities and by having its
accounts receivable staff regularly monitor receivables to expedite collection. On this basis, and since the Z
Company's receivables are related to many different customers, the concentration of credit risk on
customer receivables is low.
- Bank deposit
The majority of the Company's bank deposits are held at large, reputable banks in Vietnam. The Company
considers the concentration of credit risk in bank deposits to be low.
b. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will have difficulty fulfilling its financial obligations due to lack
of capital.
The Chairman has the ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management. The Company's liquidity risk
arises mainly from the mismatch of financial assets and financial liabilities.
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining an appropriate level of cash and cash equivalents and
borrowings at a level deemed adequate by the Board of Directors to meet the Company's operational needs
and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.
The table below summarizes the maturity of the Company's financial liabilities based on contractually
expected payments on an undiscounted basis:

Total 93.643.530.249 11.848.454.445 105.491.984.694
The Company believes that the concentration of risk with respect to debt repayment is low. The Company
is able to repay its debts when they fall due from cash flows from operations and proceeds from maturing
financial assets.

c. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market prices. Market risk includes three types: currency risk, interest rate risk
and price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and advances, deposits and
financial investments. <
The sensitivity analyses presented below are based on a constant value of net debt, with the ratio of \
fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt remaining constant.
r
- Foreign exchange risk Z
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The following table provides an analysis of the potential impact on the Company's net income after
considering the current level of exchange rates and their historical volatility as well as future market
expectations. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, will remain
unchanged and ignores the impact of sales and borrowing forecasts.
Impact on net profit
31/03/2025 01/01/2025
VND and USD exchange rate increased by 2%
VND and USD exchange rate decreased by 1%
- Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Company's interest rate risk relates primarily to cash, short-term deposits and loans.
The Company manages interest rate risk by analyzing market conditions to obtain the most favorable
interest rates while remaining within its risk management limits.
The Company does not perform a sensitivity analysis for interest rates because the risk of interest rate
changes at the reporting date is insignificant.
- Price risk
+ Stock price risk
The Company’s listed and unlisted shares are affected by market risks arising from uncertainties about
the future value of the investment shares, which may result in an increase/decrease in the value of the
investment allowance. The Company manages share price risk by setting investment limits. The
Company’s Board of Directors also reviews and approves decisions on investment in shares.
The Company will conduct analysis and present sensitivity analysis due to the impact of stock price
fluctuations on the Company's business results when there are detailed instructions from the regulatory
agencies.
