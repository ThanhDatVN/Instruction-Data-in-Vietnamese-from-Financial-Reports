No: 1871/SBH-TCKT Dak Lak, July 16th, 2025
Regarding the explanation of
changes in profit after tax in
QII/2025 compared to QII/2024
To:
- The State Securities Commission;
- Ha Noi Stock Exchange.
Pursuant to Circular No. 96/2020/TT-BTC dated 2020-11-16 of the Ministry of
Finance guiding the disclosure of information on the securities market.
Song Ba Ha Hydropower Joint Stock Company (SBH) would like to explain the

4. Total profit before tax Billion VND -21,46 39,66 61,12 284,76
5. Corporate income tax Billion VND - 7,96 7,96 -
6. Total profit after tax Billion VND -21,46 31,70 53,16 247,681. Profit After Tax in QII/2025 increased by VND 53,16 billion, equivalent to
a 247,68% rise compared to QII/2024, mainly due to the following reasons:
Total Revenue in QII/2025 increased by VND 36,06 billion, equivalent to a
57,36% rise compared to the same period in 2024. This was primarily due to a rise in
commercial electricity output in QII/2025 by 39,30 million kWh, an increase of
100,01% year-over-year.
Total Expenses in QII/2025 decreased by VND 24,74 billion, a drop of
29,34% compared to QII/2024. The main reason is that some fixed assets reached the
end of their depreciation period in the second half of 2024, leading to lower
depreciation expenses in QII/2025 compared to the same period in 2024.
2. Explanation for Net Loss in QII/2024 and Net Profit in QII/2025:
In QII/2024, revenue reached VND 62,86 billion with a commercial
electricity output of 39,26 million kWh, while total expenses amounted to VND 84,33
billion.
In QII/2025, revenue reached VND 98,92 billion with a commercial
electricity output of 78,56 million kWh, while total expenses were VND 59,59
billion.
Sincerely./.

SONG BA HA HYDRO POWER JOINT STOCK COMPANY (Issued together with Circular No. 200/2014/TT-BTC dated
December 22, 2014 of the Ministry of Finance)
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Quarter 2/2025
I. Characteristics of the enterprise's operations
1. Form of capital ownership: Joint-stock company
2. Business sector and industry: Production and trading of electricity
3. Typical production and business cycle
4. Characteristics of the Enterprise's operations affecting the Financial Statements.
5. Company structure: As of June 30, 2025, the company had 106 employees.
II. Accounting period and currency used in accounting
1. Fiscal year begins on 1 January and ends on 31 December.
2. Currency used in accounting: Vietnamese Dong (“VND”).
III. Accounting Standards and Regime Applied
1. Accounting regime: According to Circular No. 200/2014/TT-BTC dated December 22, 2014, issued by the Ministry of Finance
2. Statement of compliance with accounting standards and regimes: The financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with Vietnamese accounting standards
and regimes
IV. Accounting Policies Applied
1. Principles for converting financial statements prepared in foreign currency to Vietnamese Dong (in case the recording currency differs from Vietnamese Dong)
2. Types of foreign exchange rates applied in accounting
3. Principles for determining the effective interest rate used to discount cash flows
4. Principles for recognizing cash and cash equivalents: Including cash on hand, non-term bank deposits, short-term investments with high liquidity, easily convertible to cash,
and low risk related to value fluctuations
5. Principles for accounting financial investments:
a) For trading securities: Not applicable
b) For held-to-maturity investments:
Held-to-maturity investments include investments that the company intends and is capable of holding until maturity. These include term deposits (including treasury bills and
promissory notes), bonds, preferred shares issued with a mandatory redemption date, and other held-to-maturity investments.
Held-to-maturity investments are initially recognized at purchase cost, including transaction costs. Interest income on these investments after the purchase date is recognized
in the Income Statement on an accrual basis. Interest earned prior to the company's holding is deducted from the initial cost at the purchase date.
EVN_GL_005_TT200, Printer: LANHDT.GE2.SBH, Date: 09/01/2025 08:37:20 Page 1/29Held-to-maturity investments are carried at cost less provision for bad debts.
When there is evidence that part or all of an investment cannot be recovered and the loss can be reliably estimated, the loss is recognized as a financial expense for the period
and directly reduces the investment's carrying amount.
- The book value is determined as the initial cost plus directly related transaction costs.
c) Loans
d) Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates
d) Investments in equity instruments of other entities
e) Accounting methods for other transactions related to financial investments.
6. Principles for accounting receivables:
Receivables are presented at their carrying amount, less provisions for doubtful debts. The classification of receivables into receivables from customers and other receivables is
based on the following principles:
Receivables from customers represent trade-related receivables arising from purchase and sale transactions between the company and independent buyers.
Other receivables represent non-trade receivables unrelated to purchase and sale transactions.
Provisions for doubtful debts are made by the company for receivables overdue for payment as stated in economic contracts, agreements, or debt commitments that the company
has repeatedly demanded but has not been able to collect. The determination of overdue periods for receivables is based on the original repayment date in the initial sales
contract, excluding any debt rescheduling between parties; or for receivables not yet due but involving debtors in bankruptcy, liquidation, disappearance, or evasion, and
provisions are reversed upon recovery of the debt.
The increase or decrease in the provision for doubtful debts as of the interim financial statement closing date is recorded in administrative expenses.
7. Principles for inventory recognition
- Principle for recognizing inventory: Inventory is recognized at cost.
- Inventory valuation method: Weighted average method after each entry.
- Inventory accounting method: Perpetual method.
8. Principles for accounting and depreciation of Tangible Fixed Assets, Finance Lease Assets, and Investment Properties
a) Principles for accounting tangible fixed assets (TFA) and intangible fixed assets (IFA):
- The carrying value of fixed assets is recorded at historical cost.
- Principles for accounting costs incurred after initial recognition (upgrades, renovations, maintenance, repairs) are recognized in production and business expenses: Such costs
are added to the historical cost of the fixed asset if they are certain to increase future economic benefits derived from the use of the asset.
- Depreciation methods for fixed assets: Straight-line method based on useful life.
9. Principles for Accounting Business Cooperation Contracts (BCC)
10. Principles for Accounting Deferred Corporate Income Tax
11. Principles for Accounting Prepaid Expenses: Prepaid expenses are allocated to production and business expenses over fixed periods to ensure the principle of expense
recognition.
12. Principles for Accounting Payables: Payables and accrued expenses are recognized at the amount expected to be paid in the future for goods and services received. Payables
are detailed by each party and payment term.
13. Principles for recognizing loans and finance lease liabilities
14. Principles for recognizing and capitalizing borrowing costs
EVN_GL_005_TT200, Printer: LANHDT.GE2.SBH, Date: 09/01/2025 08:37:20 Page 2/2915. Principles for recognizing accrued expenses
16. Principles and methods for recognizing provisions
17. Principles for recognizing unearned revenue
18. Principles for recognizing convertible bonds
19. Principles for recognizing equity:
- Principles for recognizing contributed capital, capital surplus, and convertible bond options: Recognized at the actual amount contributed by shareholders. Capital surplus
is recognized as the difference between the issue price and the par value of shares issued during the first issuance.
- Principles for recognizing revaluation reserves and foreign exchange differences.
- Principles for recognizing undistributed earnings, profit distribution principles, and dividends. Post-tax profit is distributed to shareholders after appropriating reserves as
required and approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders. Dividends are recognized as liabilities upon approval by the competent authority.
20. Principles and methods for recognizing revenue and other income:
Revenue from the sale of goods and finished products is recognized when all five (5) conditions are satisfied:
- The company has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer;
- The company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;
- Revenue can be measured reliably. When a contract allows the buyer to return purchased goods under specific conditions, revenue is recognized only when such
conditions no longer exist, and the buyer is no longer entitled to return the goods (except in cases where the buyer may exchange goods for other goods or services);
- The company has received or will receive the economic benefits from the sale transaction; and
- The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Interest income on deposits is recognized on an accrual basis, calculated based on account balances and applicable interest rates. Investments are recognized when the
company has the right to receive the income.
21. Principles for accounting revenue deductions
22. Principles for accounting cost of goods sold:
- Ensuring alignment with revenue recognition principles
- Ensuring prudence principles
23. Principles and methods for recognizing financial expenses
24. Selling and administrative expenses.
25. Principles and methods for recognizing current corporate income tax expenses, deferred corporate income tax expenses:
Corporate income tax (if any) reflects the total value of current and deferred tax liabilities.
Current tax liabilities are calculated based on taxable income for the year. Taxable income differs from the net profit presented in the Income Statement as it excludes income
or expenses taxable or deductible in other years (including carryforward losses, if any) and excludes non-taxable or non-deductible items.
Corporate income tax incentives: The company is entitled to corporate income tax incentives according to Investment Certificate No. 0402081656, amended for the first time
on October 10, 2016. Accordingly, the company qualifies for corporate income tax incentives based on income from projects in areas with especially difficult socio-economic
conditions. The company is exempt from corporate income tax for 4 years starting from the first year of taxable profit (from 2010 to 2013) and receives a 50% corporate income
EVN_GL_005_TT200, Printer: LANHDT.GE2.SBH, Date: 09/01/2025 08:37:20 Page 3/29tax reduction for the next 9 years (from 2014 to 2022). In 2023 and 2024, the Company is entitled to a preferential tax rate of 10% based on its industry for a period of 15 years,
starting from the year it had taxable income, which is 2010.
