REVIEW REPORT ON INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION
■
To: The Shareholders
M Board of Directors and Executive Board
Ngan Son Joint Stock Company 00 Jj
We have reviewed the accompanying interim financial statements of Ngan Son Joint Stock Company (as the MG T
“Company”), prepared on 21 July 2025, from page 04 to page 37, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 30 phÎ
June 2025, the Statement of Income, the Statement of Cash Flows for the period from 01 January 2025 to 30 ûiS
June 2025, and the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements Du - V'
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these interim financial statements in
accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, Corporate Accounting System and legal regulations
relating to financial reporting and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility Cl
Our responsibility is to raise a conclusion on the Interim Financial Statements based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Vietnamese Standard on review engagements No. 2410 - Review of
interim financial information performed by the independent auditor of the entity.
A
The review works on the interim financial information mainly include interviews with persons in charge of
finance, accounting and application of other analysis and review procedures. Reviewing the financial
statements is basically narrower than that of auditing the financial statements in line with the Vietnamese
Standards on Auditing and therefore, it does not allow us to obtain a reasonable assurance to enable us to
detect all material issues during the engagement. Accordingly, we do not raise our audit opinion.
Auditor’s Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim
financial statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at
30 June 2025, and its financial performance and cash flows for the period from 01 January 2025 to 30 June
2025, in accordance with Vietnamese Accounting Standards, the Vietnamese Enterprise Accounting System,
and other relevant statutory requirements relating to the preparation and presentation of interim financial

Equity instrument investment risk management
The Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from its investments in equity instruments.
Investments in equity instruments are held not for trading purposes but for long-term strategic purposes.

The Company purchases raw materials, tools and goods from domestic and foreign suppliers to serve its
business operations. Therefore, the Company is exposed to the risk of changes in the selling prices of

financial losses for the company. The company has an appropriate policy and regularly monitors the
situation to assess whether it is exposed to credit risk. The maximum credit risk is represented by the
book value of the provision for bad debts as of 30 June 2025.

The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure funding to meet current and future financial
obligations. Liquidity is also managed by the company to ensure there is a buffer between maturing
debts and maturing assets during the period, at a level that can be controlled with the capital the
company believes it can generate in that period. The company’s policy is to regularly monitor current
and projected liquidity requirements to ensure that the company maintains adequate cash reserves, loans,
and sufficient capital committed by the owners to meet both short-tenn and long-term liquidity
requirements.
