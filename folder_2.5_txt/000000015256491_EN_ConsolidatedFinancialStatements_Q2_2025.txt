Normal production and business cycle
The Corporation's normal production and business cycle is carried out for a time period of 12
months or less.
Characteristics of the business activities which have impact on the separate financial
statements
The Corporation has officially operated as a joint stock company since 1 April 2016. However, at
the date of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation has not yet received a decision
approving the equitisation settlement from the competent authorities.
According to the Decision No. 2007/QD-TTg issued by the Prime Minister on 7 December 2020
on approval of the Project for allocation, management and exploitation of (i) the aviation
infrastructure assets invested and managed by the State, not included in the enterprise value when
determining enterprise value for equitisation of the Corporation, and (ii) the aviation infrastructure
assets generated after determining enterprise valuation are handed over to the State to manage
with the Ministry of Transport as the owner's representative, the Corporation is assigned to
manage, utilise and exploit these aviation infrastructure assets in a manner that does not include
the State's capital component in the enterprise from the date of issuance of the Decision to the end
of 31 December 2025; directly organise the exploitation of aviation infrastructure assets fully
reflect revenue and expenses of exploitation of aviation infrastructure assets in the Corporation’s
general bussiness results, and besides, fulfill the State's obligations for the remaining difference
on the basis of revenue minus exploitation costs. The Prime Minister assigned the Ministry of
Transport to decide on the list of aviation infrastructure assets to hand over to the Corporation to
manage, utilise and exploit immediately after this Decision takes effect.
On 1 March 2022, the Ministry of Transport issued Decision No. 256/QD-BGTVT to approve the
List of aviation infrastructure assets to be handed over to the Corporation to manage, utilise and
exploit in a manner that does not include the State's capital component in the enterprise. However,
in this decision, the Ministry of Transport has not approved the value of assets handed over to the
Corporation, therefore, as of this consolidated financial statement date, the Corporation does not
have enough a suitable basis to carry out detailed monitoring and recording of the value of
aviation Infrastructure assets. The recognition of an increase in the value of aviation infrastructure
assets will be made in accordance with the provisions of relevant accounting laws when the
Ministry of Transport issues a decision to approve the value of these assets.
Pursuant to the Resolution 18-NQ/TW dated 25 October 2017 of the Central Committee of
Communist party of Vietnam on "Certain issues regarding the continued reform and
reorganization of the political system’s organizational structure toward streamlined, efficient, and
effective operations", aviation security responsibilities have been transferred from the Ministry of
Transport to the Ministry of Public Security from 01 March 2025. At the date of this consolidated
financial statements, the Corporation is still coordinating with authorities to complete the
handover.

3. ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND SYSTEMS
Accounting convention
The Corporation adopted Vietnamese Accounting Standards, , accounting regime for
enterprises as well as related legal regulations regarding the preparation and
presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with Circular No.
202/2014/TT-BTC dated 22 December 2014 of the Ministry of Finance.
Statement of compliance with accounting standards and system
Board of General Directors of the Company undertakes to comply with requirements
of the Vietnamese Accounting Standards, , accounting regime for enterprises as well
as related legal regulations regarding the preparation and presentation of consolidated
financial statements in accordance with Circular No. 202/2014/TT-BTC dated 22
December 2014 of the Ministry of Finance.
4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies, which have been adopted by the Corporation in
the preparation of these consolidated financial statement, are as follow:
Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Vietnamese
Accounting Standards, accounting regime for enterprises and legal regulations relating
to financial reporting requires the Board of Executive Officers to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Although these
accounting estimates are based on the Board of Executive Officers’ best knowledge,
actual results may differ from those estimates.
Business combinations
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are
measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of
acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as
goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the
identifiable net assets acquired is credited to profit and loss in the year of acquisition.
The non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-controlling
shareholders’ proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities recognised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term
(not exceeding 3 months), highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in
value.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT’D)
(The attached Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements)
Financial investments
Held-to-maturity investments
Held-to-maturity investments comprise term deposits with maturity term over than 03
months.
Interest income from term deposits is recognised in the consolidated income statement
on a time basis.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Corporation has significant influence and that
is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in joint venture. Significant influence is the
power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but
not control or joint control over those policies.
The net income assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial
statements using the equity method of accounting. Interests in associates are carried
in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the
Corporation’s share of the net assets of the associate. Losses of an associate in excess
of the Corporation's interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests
that, in substance, form part of the Corporation's net investment in the associate) are
not recognised.
Where a group entity transacts with an associate of the Corporation, unrealised profits
and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Corporation’s interest in the relevant
associate.
Interests in joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Corporation and other parties
undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, i.e., the strategic
financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous
consent of the parties sharing control.
Where a group entity undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements
directly, the Corporation's share of jointly controlled assets and any liabilities incurred
jointly with other ventures are recognised in the financial statements of the relevant
entity and classified according to their nature. Liabilities and expenses incurred
directly in respect of interests in jointly controlled assets are accounted for on an
accrual basis. Income from the sale or use of the Corporation's share of the output of
jointly controlled assets, and its share of joint venture expenses, are recognised when it
is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transactions will flow
to/from the Corporation and their amount can be measured reliably.
Joint venture arrangements that involve the establishment of a separate entity in which
each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly controlled entities. The
Corporation reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method
of accounting.

(The attached Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements)
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Corporation's interest in a jointly
controlled entity is accounted for in accordance with the Corporation's accounting
policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary.
Other long-term investment
Other long-term investments represent the Corporation’s investments in ordinary
shares of the entities over which the Corporation has no control, joint control, or
significant influence. Other long-term investments are initially recognised at cost plus
transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of long-term
investments.
Provision for impairment of long-term financial investments
Provision for devaluation of investments is made when there is solid evidence as a
decline in the value of these investments at the end of period. Increases or decreases in
provision balances are accounted as financial expenses in the consolidated income
statement.
Foreign currencies
The Corporation adopted Circular No. 200/2014/TT-BTC dated 22 December 2014 of
the Ministry of Finance guiding the corporate accounting regime, including regulations
on recording, evaluating, and handling exchange rate differences within the enterprise.
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at
the transaction date. The balance of monetary items denominated in foreign currencies
at the end of the accounting period are translated at the actual exchange rate at the date
of the consolidated balance sheet. All arising exchange rate differences are accounted
for in the consolidated income statement.
Receivables
Receivables represent the amounts recoverable from customers or other debtors and
are stated at book value less provision for doubtful debts.
Provision for doubtful debts is made for overdue debts as specified in the economic
contracts, contract commitments or debt commitments that have been repeatedly
requested for payment by the Corporation but not yet collected, or when the debtor is
in bankruptcy, in dissolution, or is experiencing similar difficulties.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises
purchase prices, non-refundable taxes, transportation and stevedoring expenses,
preservation expenses during purchase, wastage norm and other directly attributable
expenses that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location
and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all
estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and
distribution.

The Corporation applies a perpetual method to record inventories. Inventories are
accounted for under perpetual inventory method. The stock-out price of material is
calculated using the first in - first out (“FIFO”) method, the stock-out price of
inventories is calculated using the weighted average method, except the stock-out price
off free-duty goods are calculated using the specific identification method.
The evaluation of necessary provision for inventory obsolescence follows current
prevailing accounting regulations which allow provisions to be made for obsolete,
damaged, or sub-standard inventories and for those which have costs higher than net
realisable values as at the balance sheet date.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The costs of
purchased tangible fixed assets comprise their purchase prices and any directly
attributable costs of bringing the assets to their working condition and location for
their intended use.
The costs of tangible fixed assets constructed by contractors comprise the finally
accounted cost of the work and any directly attributable costs of bringing the assets to
their working condition and location for their intended use.
Items which have been put into use but not yet approved by authorities will be
temporarily added to the cost of tangible fixed assets and depreciated. Upon a final
account of these tangible fixed assets, the cost will be accordingly adjusted while
depreciation expenses remain intact for adjustment (up or down) to be made over the
remaining depreciable time of the assets.
Costs incun'ed after initial recognition in respect of repairs, maintenance, upgrades and
operations of tangible fixed assets recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Unless these costs are certain to make tangible fixed assets generate economic benefits
in the future higher than initially revaluated amount, they will be debited to cost of
tangible fixed assets.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives as follows:
Years
Buildings and structures 5- 25
Machinery and equipment 3-10
Office equipment 3-5
Motor vehicles 6
Gains and losses arising from liquidation and sale of assets are the difference between
the proceeds from liquidation and the remaining value of the assets and are recorded in
the interim income statement.

Revenue from services rendered
Revenue of a transaction involving the rendering of services is recognised when the
outcome of such transactions can be measured reliably. Where a transaction involving
the rendering of services is attributable to several years, revenue is recognised in each
year by reference to the percentage of completion of the transaction at the balance
sheet date of that year. The outcome of a transaction can be measured reliably when all

Revenue deductions
Revenue deductions at the Corporation include rebate of service for carriers, which are
prorated on the total value of aviation services in monthly invoices in which the price
and charge frame are stipulated in Airports and Aerodromes by the State.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs
from profit before tax as reported in the consolidated income statement because it
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years
(including loss carried forward, if any) and it further excludes items that are never
taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is recognised on significant differences between carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax
bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using balance
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when
the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit
or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to
set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income
taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Corporation intends to settle its current
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
The determination of the tax currently payable is based on the current interpretation of
tax regulations. However, these regulations are subject to periodic variation and their
ultimate determination depends on the results of the tax authorities' examinations.
Other taxes are applied in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in Vietnam
Profit distribution, appropriation of funds from profit after tax
The Corporation distributes its profits and establishes funds in accordance with the
organisation and operation charter of the shareholding company and the Resolution of
the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.
